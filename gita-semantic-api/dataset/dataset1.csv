4:1,"श्रीभगवानुवाच |
इमं विवस्वते योगं प्रोक्तवानहमव्ययम् |
विवस्वान्मनवे प्राह मनुरिक्ष्वाकवेऽब्रवीत् || 4.1 ||","The Supreme Lord said: I instructed this imperishable science of yoga to the sun-god, Vivasvan, and Vivasvan instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Ikshvaku.","Krishna explains the lineage of the knowledge of yoga (spiritual wisdom), stating that this eternal knowledge was first given to Vivasvan (the sun-god), who passed it to Manu (the first man and lawgiver), who then passed it to his son Ikshvaku (founder of the solar dynasty). This establishes that the spiritual knowledge Krishna is sharing is ancient and has been passed down through a divine succession.","""Truth is one; sages call it by various names.""",Rigveda (Ancient Indian sacred text),"This quote from the Rigveda aligns with Krishna's message about the eternal nature of spiritual truth. Just as Krishna describes how the same yoga knowledge has been transmitted through different teachers throughout time, the Rigvedic quote suggests that underlying spiritual truths remain constant, even when expressed in different forms or through different traditions."
4:2,"एवं परम्पराप्राप्तमिमं राजर्षयो विदुः |
स कालेनेह महता योगो नष्टः परन्तप || 4.2 ||","This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way. But in course of time the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost.","Krishna continues explaining how this knowledge was passed down through generations of royal sages who preserved and practiced it. However, over time, the chain of transmission was broken, and the true understanding of this spiritual knowledge became obscured or lost to humanity.","""What is history but a fable agreed upon?""",Napoleon Bonaparte,"Napoleon's quote reflects on how historical knowledge can be lost or distorted over time, similar to Krishna's explanation of how the yoga knowledge became lost over time. Both suggest that important wisdom and truth can fade if not properly preserved through continuous transmission and practice."
4:3,"स एवायं मया तेऽद्य योगः प्रोक्तः पुरातनः |
भक्तोऽसि मे सखा चेति रहस्यं ह्येतदुत्तमम् || 4.3 ||",That very ancient science of the relationship with the Supreme is today told by Me to you because you are My devotee as well as My friend and can therefore understand the transcendental mystery of this science.,Krishna tells Arjuna that he is now revealing this ancient knowledge directly to him because Arjuna is both his devotee and friend. This special relationship makes Arjuna qualified to receive this profound spiritual wisdom that had been lost over time. Krishna implies that such knowledge is not meant for everyone but only for those who have the proper qualifications and relationship with the divine.,"""The highest education is that which does not merely give us information but makes our life in harmony with all existence.""",Rabindranath Tagore,"Tagore's quote emphasizes that true knowledge leads to harmony with existence, which parallels Krishna's teaching that this highest knowledge is given to Arjuna due to their harmonious relationship. Both suggest that the deepest wisdom is not merely intellectual but relational and transformative, bringing one into alignment with a greater reality."
4:4,"अर्जुन उवाच |
अपरं भवतो जन्म परं जन्म विवस्वतः |
कथमेतद्विजानीयां त्वमादौ प्रोक्तवानिति || 4.4 ||",Arjuna said: The sun-god Vivasvan is senior by birth to You. How am I to understand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him?,"Arjuna expresses confusion about Krishna's claim to have taught this knowledge to Vivasvan (the sun-god) who existed thousands of years before. Since Krishna appears to be a contemporary of Arjuna, this statement seems paradoxical to him. Arjuna's question leads Krishna to explain his divine nature and the concept of his repeated manifestations throughout time.","""The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.""",Albert Einstein,"Einstein's quote about the mystery being the source of true understanding resonates with Arjuna's questioning. Just as Einstein recognized that confronting mysteries leads to deeper knowledge, Arjuna's willingness to question what seems impossible opens the door to Krishna's revelation about his transcendent nature beyond ordinary time and space."
4:5,"श्रीभगवानुवाच |

तान्यहं वेद सर्वाणि न त्वं वेत्थ परन्तप || 4.5 ||","The Blessed Lord said: Many, many births both you and I have passed. I can remember all of them, but you cannot, O subduer of the enemy!","Krishna begins to reveal his divine nature by explaining that both he and Arjuna have gone through numerous births, but while Krishna can remember all of these past lives, Arjuna cannot. This highlights the difference between the ordinary consciousness of humans (who forget their past lives) and the supreme consciousness of the divine (who maintains awareness across all incarnations).","""We are not human beings having a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings having a human experience.""",Pierre Teilhard de Chardin,"Chardin's quote reflects Krishna's teaching about the continuity of existence through multiple births. Both suggest that our true identity transcends our current physical manifestation and that we have a spiritual nature that extends beyond the limitations of a single lifetime. Krishna, however, indicates that divine consciousness includes full awareness of this continuity."
4:6,"अजोऽपि सन्नव्ययात्मा भूतानामीश्वरोऽपि सन् |
प्रकृतिं स्वामधिष्ठाय सम्भवाम्यात्ममायया || 4.6 ||","Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of all living entities, I still appear in every millennium in My original transcendental form.","Krishna explains that although he is eternal, unborn, and imperishable—the supreme controller of all beings—he still manifests himself in the material world through his own divine power (maya). Unlike ordinary beings who are forced to take birth due to karma, Krishna's appearances are voluntary and part of his divine plan, maintaining his transcendental nature even while appearing in the material world.","""The Eternal Being is not to be discovered in the dimension of time.""",Abraham Joshua Heschel,"Heschel's quote about the Eternal Being transcending time aligns with Krishna's description of himself as eternally existing beyond the constraints of birth and death. Both express the paradox of the timeless entering into time—Krishna describing how he, though beyond birth, still appears within the temporal world through his divine power."
4:7,"यदा यदा हि धर्मस्य ग्लानिर्भवति भारत |
अभ्युत्थानमधर्मस्य तदात्मानं सृजाम्यहम् || 4.7 ||","Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion—at that time I descend Myself.","Krishna reveals the purpose behind his divine incarnations: whenever righteousness (dharma) declines and unrighteousness (adharma) increases in the world, he manifests himself. This verse explains the concept of divine intervention in human affairs, suggesting that God appears in the world at critical moments when human society has strayed too far from spiritual and ethical principles.","""Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.""",Martin Luther King Jr.,Dr. King's quote about light being necessary to overcome darkness parallels Krishna's explanation of his divine purpose to overcome the darkness of adharma with the light of dharma. Both suggest that negative forces cannot be overcome by similar energy but require the introduction of a higher positive force—be it divine intervention (Krishna) or love and light (King).
4:8,"परित्राणाय साधूनां विनाशाय च दुष्कृताम् |
धर्मसंस्थापनार्थाय सम्भवामि युगे युगे || 4.8 ||","To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I Myself appear, millennium after millennium.","Krishna continues to explain the purpose of his incarnations: to protect the virtuous, destroy the wicked, and reestablish dharma (righteousness/religious principles). This verse complements the previous one by elaborating on the threefold purpose of divine incarnations and confirming that this is a recurring cycle throughout cosmic history (""age after age"").","""What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make.""",Jane Goodall,"Goodall's quote about purposeful action making a difference resonates with Krishna's description of his purposeful incarnations. Both emphasize that intentional intervention can transform circumstances and protect what is valuable. While Krishna speaks on a cosmic scale about protecting dharma, Goodall speaks on a human scale about our individual responsibility to make positive changes."
4:9,"जन्म कर्म च मे दिव्यमेवं यो वेत्ति तत्त्वतः |
त्यक्त्वा देहं पुनर्जन्म नैति मामेति सोऽर्जुन || 4.9 ||","One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.","Krishna reveals that understanding the transcendental nature of his birth and activities leads to liberation from the cycle of rebirth. When one truly comprehends that Krishna's appearances are divine and not material like ordinary births, this spiritual knowledge frees them from material bondage. Upon death, instead of being reborn in the material world, such a person attains Krishna's eternal spiritual abode.","""The goal of life is to make your heartbeat match the beat of the universe, to match your nature with Nature.""",Joseph Campbell,"Campbell's quote about aligning with the universal rhythm parallels Krishna's teaching about understanding divine nature. Both suggest that true liberation comes from aligning one's understanding with a higher reality. Krishna specifically states that understanding his divine nature leads to freedom from rebirth and union with him, while Campbell speaks of the harmony that comes from aligning with universal truths."
4:10,"वीतरागभयक्रोधा मन्मया मामुपाश्रिताः |
बहवो ज्ञानतपसा पूता मद्भावमागताः || 4.10 ||","Being freed from attachment, fear and anger, being fully absorbed in Me and taking refuge in Me, many, many persons in the past became purified by knowledge of Me—and thus they all attained transcendental love for Me.","Krishna explains that many people throughout history have attained spiritual perfection by becoming free from attachment, fear, and anger, while becoming fully absorbed in and surrendered to him. Through knowledge of Krishna's true nature and devotion to him, they were purified and developed transcendental love for him, which is the highest spiritual attainment.","""The spiritual journey is the unlearning of fear and the acceptance of love.""",Marianne Williamson,"Williamson's quote about spirituality involving the unlearning of fear and acceptance of love corresponds closely with Krishna's description of the spiritual path. Both describe a process of transformation where negative emotions like fear (and also attachment and anger in Krishna's teaching) are overcome through connection with a higher spiritual reality, ultimately leading to a state of love and devotion."
4:11,"ये यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तांस्तथैव भजाम्यहम् |
मम वर्त्मानुवर्तन्ते मनुष्याः पार्थ सर्वशः || 4.11 ||","As all surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Pritha.","Krishna explains the reciprocal nature of the divine relationship: he responds to people according to how they approach him. This verse reveals the impartiality of God, who does not discriminate but responds to each person's attitude and level of surrender. It also suggests that all spiritual paths, knowingly or unknowingly, ultimately lead to Krishna, as everyone is following his path in some way or another, even if through different forms or names.","""God has no religion.""",Mahatma Gandhi,Gandhi's quote about God transcending religious boundaries reflects Krishna's universal approach to devotees. Both convey that the divine responds to sincere seekers regardless of their formal religious path or tradition. Krishna's statement that he rewards people according to their approach and that all ultimately follow his path parallels Gandhi's understanding that God exists beyond the limitations of any single religious system.
4:12,"काङ्क्षन्तः कर्मणां सिद्धिं यजन्त इह देवताः |
क्षिप्रं हि मानुषे लोके सिद्धिर्भवति कर्मजा || 4.12 ||","Men in this world desire success in fruitive activities, and therefore they worship the demigods. Quickly, of course, men get results from fruitive work in this world.","Krishna observes that people who desire material success worship various demigods (lesser deities) to fulfill their worldly ambitions. He acknowledges that such worship does indeed bring quick results in the material realm. This verse introduces a contrast between worship for material gains and worship of the Supreme for spiritual liberation, setting up Krishna's explanation of the hierarchy of spiritual understanding.","""The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.""",Lao Tzu,"Lao Tzu's quote about beginning a journey with small steps parallels Krishna's recognition that worshipping demigods for material success represents an initial step in spiritual evolution. Both acknowledge that people often begin their spiritual journey seeking tangible, immediate results before moving toward higher understanding. Krishna recognizes this approach as valid but limited, while Lao Tzu emphasizes the importance of simply beginning the journey."
4:13,"चातुर्वर्ण्यं मया सृष्टं गुणकर्मविभागशः |
तस्य कर्तारमपि मां विद्ध्यकर्तारमव्ययम् || 4.13 ||","According to the three modes of material nature and the work associated with them, the four divisions of human society are created by Me. And although I am the creator of this system, you should know that I am yet the nondoer, being unchangeable.","Krishna explains that he created the four divisions of society (varna system) based on qualities (gunas) and activities (karma), not by birth. However, he clarifies that though he established this system, he remains detached from it and is not directly involved in its operations. This reveals the paradoxical nature of the divine as both the creator of cosmic order and yet transcendent to it, establishing natural laws while remaining beyond their influence.","""True equality means holding everyone to the same standard. But that's not what social justice is. Social justice means giving everyone the same thing.""",Thomas Sowell,"Sowell's quote distinguishes between equality of standards versus equality of outcomes, which resonates with Krishna's explanation of the varna system based on qualities and actions rather than birth. Both suggest that true social organization should recognize natural differences in abilities and inclinations while maintaining equal dignity. Krishna establishes that the divine order accounts for natural diversity while transcending it, similar to how Sowell suggests standards can be universal while acknowledging individual differences."
4:14,"न मां कर्माणि लिम्पन्ति न मे कर्मफले स्पृहा |
इति मां योऽभिजानाति कर्मभिर्न स बध्यते || 4.14 ||",There is no work that affects Me; nor do I aspire for the fruits of action. One who understands this truth about Me also does not become entangled in the fruitive reactions of work.,"Krishna explains that he is not affected by actions nor desires their results, highlighting his complete detachment despite being the supreme controller. He then states that those who truly understand this aspect of his nature can also achieve freedom from the bondage of karma. This verse introduces the important concept that liberation comes through understanding the transcendental nature of God and emulating his detached attitude toward work.","""Work is love made visible.""",Kahlil Gibran,"Gibran's quote about work being an expression of love connects with Krishna's teaching about detached action. Both suggest a transcendent approach to work that goes beyond self-interest. While Krishna emphasizes freedom from attachment to results, Gibran points to the transformation of work through love. Both perspectives elevate work from mere labor to a spiritual practice—Krishna through detachment and Gibran through the infusion of love."
4:15,"एवं ज्ञात्वा कृतं कर्म पूर्वैरपि मुमुक्षुभिः |
कुरु कर्मैव तस्मात्त्वं पूर्वैः पूर्वतरं कृतम् || 4.15 ||","All the liberated souls in ancient times acted with this understanding of My transcendental nature. Therefore you should perform your duty, following in their footsteps.","Krishna urges Arjuna to follow the example of previous seekers of liberation who performed their duties with proper understanding of the divine nature. This establishes the authority of tradition and the importance of learning from those who have successfully walked the spiritual path before. Krishna emphasizes that action with proper understanding, not inaction, is the way to spiritual freedom.","""Stand on the shoulders of giants.""",Isaac Newton,"Newton's famous quote about advancing by building on the achievements of predecessors parallels Krishna's instruction to follow the example of previous liberated souls. Both emphasize the value of learning from those who came before rather than trying to forge an entirely new path. Krishna encourages Arjuna to act with understanding as his predecessors did, just as Newton acknowledged that progress comes through building upon established wisdom."
4:16,"किं कर्म किमकर्मेति कवयोऽप्यत्र मोहिताः |
तत्ते कर्म प्रवक्ष्यामि यज्ज्ञात्वा मोक्ष्यसेऽशुभात् || 4.16 ||","Even the intelligent are bewildered in determining what is action and what is inaction. Now I shall explain to you what action is, knowing which you shall be liberated from all misfortune.","Krishna acknowledges that understanding the true nature of action and inaction is confusing even for the wise. He then promises to explain this complex topic to Arjuna, indicating that proper understanding of action is crucial for liberation. This verse highlights the subtle nature of spiritual knowledge, where apparent contradictions (like how to act without being bound by action) require deep insight beyond conventional understanding.","""The most important thing is to keep the most important thing the most important thing.""",Stephen Covey,"Covey's quote about maintaining clarity on priorities connects with Krishna's emphasis on understanding the essence of action. Both point to the importance of discernment—seeing beyond confusion to grasp fundamental principles. Krishna acknowledges the complexity of distinguishing true action from inaction, while Covey similarly recognizes how easily we can lose sight of what truly matters. Both suggest that wisdom lies in this crucial discernment."
4:17,"कर्मणो ह्यपि बोद्धव्यं बोद्धव्यं च विकर्मणः |
अकर्मणश्च बोद्धव्यं गहना कर्मणो गतिः || 4.17 ||","The intricacies of action are very hard to understand. Therefore one should know properly what action is, what forbidden action is, and what inaction is.","Krishna explains that there are three aspects of action that must be understood: proper action (karma), prohibited action (vikarma), and inaction (akarma). He emphasizes that understanding the nature of action is profound and complex (""the course of action is very deep""). This verse establishes that spiritual understanding requires nuanced discernment rather than simplistic categorization, and that comprehending the mysteries of action and its consequences is essential for spiritual growth.","""Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.""",Viktor Frankl,"Frankl's quote about the space between stimulus and response parallels Krishna's teaching about understanding different types of action. Both point to the importance of conscious discernment in how we act. Krishna emphasizes the need to distinguish between proper action, forbidden action, and inaction, while Frankl highlights the transformative power that comes from awareness of our choices. Both suggest that freedom comes through this deeper understanding of action and its implications."
4:18,"कर्मण्यकर्म यः पश्येदकर्मणि च कर्म यः |
स बुद्धिमान्मनुष्येषु स युक्तः कृत्स्नकर्मकृत् || 4.18 ||","One who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction, is intelligent among men, and he is in the transcendental position, although engaged in all sorts of activities.","Krishna reveals a profound paradox: the truly wise person sees inaction in action and action in inaction. This means recognizing that actions performed without attachment and ego (with spiritual awareness) are actually a form of inaction because they don't create karmic bondage. Conversely, apparent inaction driven by fear, confusion, or attachment is actually binding action. This verse highlights the importance of consciousness and intention over external appearance in determining the spiritual value of action.","""What we are is what we have been, and what we will be is what we do now.""",Buddha,"Buddha's quote about our present actions determining our future connects with Krishna's teaching about the transformative understanding of action. Both emphasize that the nature and quality of action transcend simple appearance. Krishna reveals that spiritually informed action (seeing inaction in action) liberates rather than binds, which parallels Buddha's teaching that mindful action in the present shapes our future state. Both point to transcending ordinary perceptions of cause and effect through spiritual awareness."
4:19,"यस्य सर्वे समारम्भाः कामसङ्कल्पवर्जिताः |
ज्ञानाग्निदग्धकर्माणं तमाहुः पण्डितं बुधाः || 4.19 ||",One is understood to be in full knowledge whose every endeavor is devoid of desire for sense gratification. He is said by sages to be a worker for whom the reactions of work have been burned up by the fire of perfect knowledge.,"Krishna describes the person of true wisdom as one whose actions are free from desire and self-centered planning. Such a person's karma (the reactions to their actions) is burned away by the fire of perfect knowledge. This verse emphasizes that liberation comes not from ceasing activity but from transforming the consciousness behind action, performing duties without selfish motivation or attachment to results.","""The highest reward for a person's toil is not what they get for it, but what they become by it.""",John Ruskin,"Ruskin's quote about the true reward of work being personal transformation aligns with Krishna's teaching about knowledge-purified action. Both suggest that the highest value of work is not external results but internal transformation. Krishna speaks of actions purified by knowledge that burns away karmic reactions, while Ruskin points to how work transforms the worker. Both perspectives shift focus from the fruits of action to its transformative power."
4:20,"त्यक्त्वा कर्मफलासङ्गं नित्यतृप्तो निराश्रयः |
कर्मण्यभिप्रवृत्तोऽपि नैव किञ्चित्करोति सः || 4.20 ||","Abandoning all attachment to the results of his activities, ever satisfied and independent, he performs no fruitive action, although engaged in all kinds of undertakings.","Krishna describes the state of a person who has abandoned attachment to the fruits of action. Such a person remains internally content and self-sufficient, not dependent on external outcomes for satisfaction. Though actively engaged in various activities, they are not actually ""doing"" anything in the karmic sense because their actions don't create binding consequences. This verse highlights the paradoxical freedom that comes from acting without attachment—full engagement in the world without being bound by it.","""The secret of happiness is freedom, and the secret of freedom is courage.""",Thucydides,"Thucydides' quote about freedom requiring courage connects with Krishna's description of detached action. Both point to the liberating power of releasing attachment to outcomes. Krishna describes how abandoning attachment to results leads to a state of perpetual contentment and inner freedom, while Thucydides suggests that true happiness comes through freedom, which requires the courage to let go. Both perspectives recognize that liberation comes through relinquishing control rather than grasping for it."
4:21,"निराशीर्यतचित्तात्मा त्यक्तसर्वपरिग्रहः |
शारीरं केवलं कर्म कुर्वन्नाप्नोति किल्बिषम् || 4.21 ||","Such a man of understanding acts with mind and intelligence perfectly controlled, gives up all sense of proprietorship over his possessions, and acts only for the bare necessities of life. Thus working, he is not affected by sinful reactions.","Krishna further describes the enlightened person who has controlled their mind and given up all sense of ownership or possession. Such a person performs actions only for basic maintenance of the body without attachment. By acting without possessiveness and only for necessary purposes, they remain free from the sinful reactions that normally bind actions. This verse emphasizes minimalism and non-attachment as key aspects of liberated action.","""The things you own end up owning you.""",Tyler Durden (character from Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk),"This quote reflects Krishna's teaching about renouncing possessiveness and the sense of ownership. Both suggest that attachment to possessions creates bondage rather than freedom. Krishna describes how one who has given up ""all sense of proprietorship"" and acts only for essential needs remains free from karmic reactions, while the quote similarly implies that possessions create attachments that ultimately control and limit us rather than serve us."
4:22,"यदृच्छालाभसन्तुष्टो द्वन्द्वातीतो विमत्सरः |
समः सिद्धावसिद्धौ च कृत्वापि न निबध्यते || 4.22 ||","He who is satisfied with gain which comes of its own accord, who is free from duality and does not envy, who is steady in both success and failure, is never entangled, although performing actions.","Krishna continues describing the liberated person who remains content with whatever comes naturally, without special effort. Such a person has transcended duality (pleasure/pain, like/dislike), is free from envy, and maintains equanimity in both success and failure. Even while acting in the world, they remain unbound by their actions because of this inner balance and acceptance. This verse highlights contentment and equanimity as essential qualities of spiritual freedom.","""Happiness is not having what you want, but wanting what you have.""","Attributed to various sources, including Rabbi Hyman Schachtel","This quote directly parallels Krishna's teaching about being ""satisfied with gain which comes of its own accord."" Both emphasize that contentment comes from acceptance and appreciation of what naturally arrives rather than striving after desires. Krishna describes freedom as arising from this contentment combined with equanimity toward success and failure, while the quote similarly suggests that happiness comes from aligning desires with reality rather than constantly seeking to change circumstances."
4:23,"गतसङ्गस्य मुक्तस्य ज्ञानावस्थितचेतसः |
यज्ञायाचरतः कर्म समग्रं प्रविलीयते || 4.23 ||",The work of a man who is unattached to the modes of material nature and who is fully situated in transcendental knowledge merges entirely into transcendence.,"Krishna explains that for one who has transcended attachment, attained liberation, and established consciousness in spiritual knowledge, all actions become sacred offerings (yajna). Such a person's actions dissolve completely into the transcendental realm, leaving no karmic residue. This verse introduces the concept that through proper consciousness, all activities can be transformed into spiritual practice, dissolving the distinction between mundane and sacred action.","""The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away.""",Pablo Picasso,"Picasso's quote about finding one's gift and giving it away resonates with Krishna's teaching about action performed as sacred offering (yajna). Both suggest a transformation where personal action becomes something offered beyond oneself. Krishna describes how actions of the enlightened dissolve into transcendence when performed without attachment and with spiritual knowledge, while Picasso points to how discovering and sharing one's unique gifts creates meaning through selfless offering."
4:24,"ब्रह्मार्पणं ब्रह्म हविर्ब्रह्माग्नौ ब्रह्मणा हुतम् |
ब्रह्मैव तेन गन्तव्यं ब्रह्मकर्मसमाधिना || 4.24 ||","A person who is fully absorbed in Krishna consciousness is sure to attain the spiritual kingdom because of his full contribution to spiritual activities, in which the consummation is absolute and that which is offered is of the same spiritual nature.","Krishna describes the complete unity of spiritual action in which everything involved in the sacrifice is divine: the offering is Brahman (Divine Reality), the oblation is Brahman, the fire is Brahman, the act of offering is performed by Brahman, and the goal to be attained is Brahman. This verse reveals the non-dual nature of spiritualized action where all distinctions dissolve into the unified field of divine consciousness. It indicates that when one perceives the divine in every aspect of action, they attain the supreme state of consciousness.","""In a gentle way, you can shake the world.""",Mahatma Gandhi,"Gandhi's quote about gentle action having profound impact connects with Krishna's teaching about spiritualized action. Both point to the transformative power that comes from alignment with higher principles. Krishna describes how actions performed with awareness of the all-pervading divine nature lead to the attainment of Brahman, while Gandhi suggests that even small actions, when aligned with truth (a manifestation of Brahman), can transform the world. Both emphasize the potency of action that emerges from spiritual consciousness."
4:25,"दैवमेवापरे यज्ञं योगिनः पर्युपासते |
ब्रह्माग्नावपरे यज्ञं यज्ञेनैवोपजुह्वति || 4.25 ||","Some yogis perfectly worship the demigods by offering different sacrifices to them, and some of them offer sacrifices in the fire of the Supreme Brahman.","Krishna begins describing various types of sacrifices (yajnas) performed by different practitioners. Some yogis perform sacrifices to worship celestial beings (devas), while others offer the sacrifice itself as an offering into the fire of Brahman (the Ultimate Reality). This verse begins a section comparing different spiritual practices, showing how various approaches can all be forms of sacrifice leading to spiritual progress, though with different levels of understanding and efficacy.","""There are many paths to the top of the mountain, but the view is always the same.""",Chinese Proverb,"This Chinese proverb about multiple paths leading to the same summit resonates with Krishna's description of different forms of sacrifice. Both acknowledge the validity of various spiritual approaches while suggesting they ultimately converge. Krishna outlines how some worship deities while others offer directly to Brahman, implying a hierarchy of practice but acknowledging the value of different methods, similar to how the proverb validates diverse paths while affirming they lead to the same ultimate viewpoint."
4:26,"श्रोत्रादीनीन्द्रियाण्यन्ये संयमाग्निषु जुह्वति |
शब्दादीन्विषयानन्य इन्द्रियाग्निषु जुह्वति || 4.26 ||","Some of them sacrifice the hearing process and the senses in the fire of mental control, and others sacrifice the objects of the senses in the fire of the senses.","Krishna continues describing different types of sacrifices, focusing now on sensory discipline. Some practitioners sacrifice the senses themselves (the faculties of perception) in the fire of self-control, while others sacrifice the objects of senses (what is perceived) in the fire of the senses themselves. This verse shows how spiritual practice can involve either withdrawing the senses from their objects (pratyahara) or engaging with sense objects with awareness and discipline—both approaches representing valid but different forms of sacrifice.","""The world is full of magic things, patiently waiting for our senses to grow sharper.""",W.B. Yeats,"Yeats' quote about sharpening the senses to perceive magic relates to Krishna's teaching about the sacrifice of sensory experience. While Krishna describes how some practitioners sacrifice sense objects and others sacrifice the senses themselves in spiritual discipline, Yeats suggests a refinement of sensory perception that reveals deeper dimensions of reality. Both point to the transformation of ordinary perception through spiritual practice, though Krishna's approach emphasizes control while Yeats emphasizes heightened awareness."
4:27,"सर्वाणीन्द्रियकर्माणि प्राणकर्माणि चापरे |
आत्मसंयमयोगाग्नौ जुह्वति ज्ञानदीपिते || 4.27 ||","Others, who are interested in achieving self-realization through control of the mind and senses, offer the functions of all the senses, and of the life breath, as oblations into the fire of the controlled mind.",Krishna describes practitioners who offer all sensory activities and vital functions (prana) as oblations into the fire of self-discipline kindled by knowledge. This verse refers to advanced yoga practices where all physiological and psychological functions are brought under conscious control and offered into the illuminated consciousness. This represents a more comprehensive form of sacrifice that integrates control of both external senses and internal life energies through knowledge-guided discipline.,"""The mind is everything. What you think you become.""",Buddha,"Buddha's quote about the mind determining what we become parallels Krishna's teaching about sacrificing all functions into the fire of the controlled mind. Both emphasize the primary importance of mental discipline in spiritual transformation. Krishna describes the practice of offering all sensory and vital functions as sacrifices into the ""fire of the controlled mind illumined by knowledge,"" while Buddha similarly points to the mind as the fundamental determinant of our being and becoming."
4:28,"द्रव्ययज्ञास्तपोयज्ञा योगयज्ञास्तथापरे |
स्वाध्यायज्ञानयज्ञाश्च यतयः संशितव्रताः || 4.28 ||","Having accepted strict vows, some become enlightened by sacrificing their possessions, and others by performing severe austerities, by practicing the yoga of eightfold mysticism, or by studying the Vedas to advance in transcendental knowledge.","Krishna continues cataloging various forms of sacrifice: some sacrifice material possessions (charity), others perform austerities (tapas), some practice the eightfold system of yoga, and others study sacred texts for advancement in knowledge. This verse demonstrates the diverse paths of spiritual practice, all characterized as different forms of sacrifice requiring discipline and commitment. It shows that spiritual advancement can occur through multiple approaches—material renunciation, physical discipline, systematic spiritual practice, or intellectual study.","""Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power.""",Lao Tzu,"Lao Tzu's quote about self-mastery being true wisdom and power aligns with Krishna's description of various disciplines as paths to enlightenment. Both emphasize the value of self-discipline and inner development. Krishna outlines multiple approaches to spiritual sacrifice—material, physical, yogic, and intellectual—while Lao Tzu similarly distinguishes between external mastery and the superior discipline of self-mastery. Both suggest that true advancement comes through disciplined self-cultivation rather than external conquest."
4:29,"अपाने जुह्वति प्राणं प्राणेऽपानं तथापरे |

अपरे नियताहाराः प्राणान्प्राणेषु जुह्वति || 4.29 ||","Still others, who are inclined to the process of breath restraint to remain in trance, practice by offering the movement of the outgoing breath into the incoming, and the incoming breath into the outgoing, and thus at last remain in trance, stopping all breathing. Others, curtailing the eating process, offer the outgoing breath into itself as a sacrifice.","Krishna describes advanced pranayama (breath control) practices as forms of sacrifice. Some practitioners offer the outgoing breath (prana) into the incoming breath (apana) and vice versa, eventually suspending breath in a state of trance. Others restrict their food intake and offer their life-forces into themselves. This verse details specific yogic techniques involving the control of vital energies as spiritual sacrifice, showing how even physiological functions can be transformed into sacred practice through conscious regulation and internalization.","""Breath is the bridge which connects life to consciousness, which unites your body to your thoughts.""",Thich Nhat Hanh,"Thich Nhat Hanh's quote about breath connecting life, consciousness, and thought aligns with Krishna's teaching about pranayama as spiritual sacrifice. Both recognize the profound significance of breath beyond mere physiology. Krishna describes detailed techniques of offering the breaths into each other and achieving trance through breath control, while Thich Nhat Hanh similarly identifies breath as the connective medium between different dimensions of being—physical, mental, and spiritual."
4:30,"सर्वेऽप्येते यज्ञविदो यज्ञक्षपितकल्मषाः |
यज्ञशिष्टामृतभुजो यान्ति ब्रह्म सनातनम् || 4.30 ||","All these performers who know the meaning of sacrifice become cleansed of sinful reactions, and, having tasted the nectar of the results of sacrifices, they advance toward the supreme eternal atmosphere.","Krishna concludes this section by stating that all these various practitioners who understand the true meaning of sacrifice have their impurities destroyed by their sacrificial practices. Having tasted the ""nectar of sacrifice"" (the spiritual fulfillment that comes from sacred action), they progress toward the eternal Brahman, the supreme reality. This verse emphasizes that despite the diversity of approaches, all authentic sacrificial practices lead to purification and spiritual advancement when performed with proper understanding, ultimately guiding the practitioner toward the same eternal destination.","""We are not human beings having a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings having a human experience.""",Pierre Teilhard de Chardin,"Chardin's quote about our essential spiritual nature connects with Krishna's teaching about various sacrifices leading to the eternal Brahman. Both point to the transcendent dimension of human existence. Krishna describes how diverse spiritual practices ultimately lead practitioners to the ""supreme eternal atmosphere"" when performed with understanding, while Chardin similarly suggests that our true identity is spiritual rather than material. Both perspectives emphasize that authentic spiritual practice reconnects us with our eternal nature that transcends temporal existence."
4:31,"यज्ञशिष्टामृतभुजो यान्ति ब्रह्म सनातनम् ।
नायं लोकोऽस्त्ययज्ञस्य कुतोऽन्यः कुरुसत्तम ॥४-३१॥","Those who partake of the nectar of the remnants of sacrifices go to the eternal Brahman. This world is not for one who performs no sacrifice; how then can the other world be for him, O best of the Kurus?","This verse emphasizes the importance of yajna (sacrifice) and selfless action. Those who perform actions as sacrifice and partake only of what remains after offering to the divine attain the eternal. Krishna explains that those who live without the spirit of sacrifice cannot find happiness even in this world, let alone spiritual liberation.",,Mahatma Gandhi,"Gandhi's quote captures the essence of yajna in modern terms—the sacrifice of one's ego and self-interest in service to others. Just as Krishna teaches that sacrifice leads to the eternal, Gandhi suggests that selfless service leads to self-discovery and fulfillment, echoing the spiritual principle that giving up attachment to fruits of action leads to liberation."
4:32,"एवं बहुविधा यज्ञा वितता ब्रह्मणो मुखे ।
कर्मजान्विद्धि तान्सर्वानेवं ज्ञात्वा विमोक्ष्यसे ॥४-३२॥","Various types of sacrifices are spread out before Brahman (are described in the Vedas). Know them all to be born of action, and having known this, you shall be liberated.","Krishna explains that all forms of sacrifice ultimately stem from action (karma). Understanding that all spiritual practices involve action, and performing these actions without attachment, leads to liberation. This verse highlights the diversity of spiritual paths while emphasizing that all paths involve some form of sacrifice through action.",,Mahatma Gandhi,"Gandhi's quote relates to this verse by suggesting that even small actions performed with the right spirit can have profound effects. Similarly, Krishna teaches that liberation comes not from avoiding action but from understanding the nature of action and sacrifice. Both emphasize that transformative power comes through right action rather than inaction."
4:33,"श्रेयान्द्रव्यमयाद्यज्ञाज्ज्ञानयज्ञः परन्तप ।
सर्वं कर्माखिलं पार्थ ज्ञाने परिसमाप्यते ॥४-३३॥","Superior to the sacrifice of material possessions is the sacrifice of knowledge, O scorcher of foes. All actions in their entirety, O Partha, culminate in knowledge.","This verse establishes the hierarchy of sacrifices, placing the sacrifice of knowledge (jnana yajna) above material sacrifices. Krishna tells Arjuna that while all forms of sacrifice are valuable, the pursuit of spiritual knowledge is supreme because all actions ultimately find their fulfillment in wisdom. True knowledge leads to the understanding that the self is not the doer.",,Socrates,"Socrates' famous statement about wisdom reflects the paradoxical nature of true knowledge that Krishna describes. Just as Krishna places the sacrifice of knowledge above material sacrifices, Socrates suggests that genuine wisdom begins with acknowledging our limitations. Both point to a transcendent understanding that goes beyond conventional knowledge or material concerns."
4:34,"तद्विद्धि प्रणिपातेन परिप्रश्नेन सेवया ।
उपदेक्ष्यन्ति ते ज्ञानं ज्ञानिनस्तत्त्वदर्शिनः ॥४-३४॥","Learn that knowledge by prostrating, by questions, and by service. The wise, who have realized the truth, will impart that knowledge to you.","Krishna advises Arjuna on how to acquire spiritual knowledge: through humility (prostration), sincere inquiry (questioning), and service to the teacher. This verse highlights the traditional guru-disciple relationship and the attitudes necessary for receiving spiritual wisdom. True knowledge comes from those who have direct perception of reality.",,Buddha,"This Buddhist proverb captures the essence of Krishna's instruction about approaching spiritual teachers. Both emphasize that genuine spiritual knowledge is transmitted through a relationship characterized by the student's readiness and receptivity. The sloka outlines the specific qualities needed—humility, curiosity, and service—while the proverb suggests that these qualities naturally attract the appropriate teacher."
4:35,"यज्ज्ञात्वा न पुनर्मोहमेवं यास्यसि पाण्डव ।
येन भूतान्यशेषेण द्रक्ष्यस्यात्मन्यथो मयि ॥४-३५॥","Knowing which, you shall not again fall into delusion, O Pandava; and by that, you shall see all beings in your Self, and also in Me.","Krishna explains the transformative power of spiritual knowledge. Once obtained, this knowledge permanently dispels the illusion of separateness, enabling one to perceive the fundamental unity of all existence. The enlightened person sees all beings as existing within their own Self and within the divine, recognizing the interconnectedness of all life.",,Ram Dass,"Ram Dass's quote beautifully mirrors Krishna's teaching about the unity of all beings. Just as Krishna speaks of seeing all beings in oneself and in the divine, Ram Dass expresses the profound recognition that we are all on the same journey toward spiritual home. Both convey the dissolution of separation that comes with spiritual awakening—the understanding that we are not isolated individuals but manifestations of the same consciousness."
4:36,"अपि चेदसि पापेभ्यः सर्वेभ्यः पापकृत्तमः ।
सर्वं ज्ञानप्लवेनैव वृजिनं सन्तरिष्यसि ॥४-३६॥","Even if you are the most sinful of all sinners, you will cross over all sin by the raft of knowledge.","In this powerful verse, Krishna assures Arjuna that spiritual knowledge has the capacity to transcend all past actions, even the most negative ones. Knowledge is compared to a raft that carries one across the ocean of sin or ignorance. This verse offers hope and emphasizes that spiritual liberation is available to everyone, regardless of past mistakes.",,George Eliot,"George Eliot's quote resonates with Krishna's message of redemption through knowledge. Both emphasize that our future spiritual potential is not limited by our past. Just as Krishna teaches that even the greatest sinner can transcend past actions through the raft of knowledge, Eliot suggests that our true potential remains available to us regardless of previous choices or circumstances."
4:37,"यथैधांसि समिद्धोऽग्निर्भस्मसात्कुरुतेऽर्जुन ।
ज्ञानाग्निः सर्वकर्माणि भस्मसात्कुरुते तथा ॥४-३७॥","As the blazing fire reduces wood to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge reduce all actions to ashes.","Krishna uses a powerful metaphor of fire consuming wood to illustrate how spiritual knowledge consumes the karmic effects of all actions. Just as fire transforms wood into ashes, the fire of knowledge transforms the binding effects of karma. This verse further elaborates on the transformative power of knowledge introduced in the previous verse.",,Emerson,"Emerson's quote captures the irreversible transformative power of knowledge that Krishna describes. Just as Krishna portrays knowledge as a fire that permanently transforms actions to ashes, Emerson suggests that genuine insights permanently expand our consciousness. Both express the idea that true knowledge creates a fundamental and irreversible change in one's being."
4:38,"न हि ज्ञानेन सदृशं पवित्रमिह विद्यते ।
तत्स्वयं योगसंसिद्धः कालेनात्मनि विन्दति ॥४-३८॥","Verily, there is nothing in this world as purifying as knowledge. One who has become perfect in yoga finds it within himself in time.","Krishna declares that nothing in this world purifies like knowledge, highlighting its supreme value. He adds that this knowledge naturally reveals itself within a person who has perfected yoga (the disciplined path of spiritual practice). This verse emphasizes both the purifying power of knowledge and the fact that it arises from within through spiritual discipline over time.",,Jesus,Jesus's statement about the divine kingdom being within parallels Krishna's teaching that spiritual knowledge is found within oneself through yogic practice. Both spiritual teachers point to an internal rather than external source of ultimate truth and transformation. They suggest that the highest spiritual realization comes through turning inward rather than seeking outside ourselves.
4:39,"श्रद्धावाँल्लभते ज्ञानं तत्परः संयतेन्द्रियः ।
ज्ञानं लब्ध्वा परां शान्तिमचिरेणाधिगच्छति ॥४-३९॥","The person of faith, devoted to knowledge, and master of the senses, attains knowledge; and having attained knowledge, quickly reaches supreme peace.","Krishna outlines the qualities needed to attain spiritual knowledge: faith (shraddha), devoted effort, and sensory control. When these qualities are present, knowledge arises naturally, and with it comes supreme peace. This verse offers a practical path to knowledge, emphasizing both the prerequisites and the result of spiritual wisdom.",,Martin Luther King Jr.,"Dr. King's perspective on faith resonates with Krishna's teaching about shraddha (faith) as the foundation for spiritual knowledge. Both suggest that faith is not blind belief but a confident first step on the spiritual journey. Krishna teaches that faith leads to knowledge and then to peace, while King implies that faith initiates a journey toward goals we cannot yet fully perceive but can trust will unfold."
4:40,"अज्ञश्चाश्रद्दधानश्च संशयात्मा विनश्यति ।
नायं लोकोऽस्ति न परो न सुखं संशयात्मनः ॥४-४०॥","The ignorant, the faithless, and the doubter perish. For the doubter, there is neither this world nor the next nor any happiness.","Krishna warns about the consequences of doubt, ignorance, and lack of faith. He emphasizes that the perpetual doubter, unable to commit to a path of knowledge, finds no peace or happiness in any realm. This verse highlights the importance of resolving doubt through committed spiritual practice rather than remaining in a state of perpetual skepticism.",,Shakespeare,"Shakespeare's insight about the self-defeating nature of doubt parallels Krishna's warning. Both suggest that excessive doubt prevents progress and fulfillment. Krishna teaches that the doubting mind finds neither worldly nor spiritual happiness, while Shakespeare identifies doubt as the ""traitor"" that prevents us from achieving what might otherwise be possible through decisive action."
4:41,"योगसंन्यस्तकर्माणं ज्ञानसञ्छिन्नसंशयम् ।
आत्मवन्तं न कर्माणि निबध्नन्ति धनञ्जय ॥४-४१॥","Actions do not bind one who has renounced action through yoga, whose doubts are rent asunder by knowledge, and who is self-possessed, O conqueror of wealth (Arjuna).","Krishna explains that one who performs actions with yogic detachment, whose doubts have been dispelled by knowledge, and who has mastered the self, is not bound by actions. This verse describes the liberated state where one acts in the world without creating karmic bondage, having transcended identification with the doer through spiritual understanding.",,Mahatma Gandhi,"Gandhi's perspective on freedom complements Krishna's teaching about action without bondage. While Krishna speaks of freedom from the binding effects of action through spiritual knowledge, Gandhi points to the importance of freedom in action itself. Both recognize a form of liberation that doesn't avoid action but transforms one's relationship with it—Krishna through transcendence of identification with action, and Gandhi through embracing the full spectrum of human action including mistakes."
4:42,"तस्मादज्ञानसम्भूतं हृत्स्थं ज्ञानासिनात्मनः ।
छित्त्वैनं संशयं योगमातिष्ठोत्तिष्ठ भारत ॥४-४२॥","Therefore, cutting asunder the doubt in your heart born of ignorance with the sword of knowledge, resort to yoga and arise, O Bharata (Arjuna).","In the concluding verse of Chapter 4, Krishna directly addresses Arjuna's doubt and hesitation. He urges Arjuna to use the sword of knowledge to cut through doubts born of ignorance, to establish himself in yoga (the disciplined path of action without attachment), and to arise to his duty. This verse serves as both a practical instruction and an inspirational call to action.",,Joan Baez,"Joan Baez's quote echoes Krishna's call to action as a solution to inner conflict. Both suggest that resolute action based on clear understanding is the remedy for psychological paralysis. Krishna advises Arjuna to cut through doubt with knowledge and then act through yoga, while Baez similarly identifies action as the way beyond despair, recognizing that purposeful engagement can overcome the paralysis of uncertainty or negative emotion."
5:1,"अर्जुन उवाच |

Tell me decisively, which one is better?",Arjuna is confused about Krishna's teachings on renunciation (Sannyasa) and selfless action (Karma Yoga) and seeks clarity on the superior path.,The mind is everything. What you think you become.,Buddha,Buddha's idea resonates with Arjuna’s dilemma—one’s state of mind and approach define the true path to enlightenment.
5:2,"श्रीभगवानुवाच |

तयोस्तु कर्मसंन्यासात्कर्मयोगो विशिष्यते ॥५-२॥","The Blessed Lord said: Both renunciation and selfless action lead to liberation, but of the two, selfless action is superior.","Krishna explains that while renunciation (giving up worldly duties) and Karma Yoga (acting selflessly) both lead to the ultimate goal, Karma Yoga is more practical and beneficial.",Action is the foundational key to all success.,Pablo Picasso,"Krishna’s teaching aligns with Picasso’s belief—action, rather than mere detachment, leads to true fulfillment."
5:3,"ज्ञेयः स नित्यसंन्यासी यो न द्वेष्टि न काङ्क्षति |
निर्द्वन्द्वो हि महाबाहो सुखं बन्धात्प्रमुच्यते ॥५-३॥","One who neither hates nor desires is to be recognized as a true renunciate. Being free from dualities, such a person is easily liberated.","True renunciation does not mean abandoning work, but letting go of attachment and aversion. A balanced mind leads to liberation.",Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.,Mahatma Gandhi,Krishna’s message about detachment aligns with Gandhi’s view—true freedom lies in neutrality and acceptance.
5:4,"साङ्ख्ययोगौ पृथग्बालाः प्रवदन्ति न पण्डिताः |
एकमप्यास्थितः सम्यगुभयोर्विन्दते फलम् ॥५-४॥","Foolish people see Sankhya (knowledge) and Karma Yoga (selfless action) as different, but the wise see them as leading to the same goal.",Knowledge and action are not opposing paths but complementary. Those with true wisdom understand that both lead to liberation.,Knowledge without action is meaningless.,Abu Bakr,"Krishna’s view matches Abu Bakr’s—wisdom is incomplete without action, and action without wisdom lacks direction."
5:5,"यत्साङ्ख्यैः प्राप्यते स्थानं तद्योगैरपि गम्यते |
एकं साङ्ख्यं च योगं च यः पश्यति स पश्यति ॥५-५॥",The state attained by Sankhya (knowledge) is also reached through Karma Yoga (action). One who sees both as one truly sees.,"Krishna affirms that whether through wisdom or selfless work, both lead to the same divine realization. True understanding comes from seeing them as one.",The only source of knowledge is experience.,Albert Einstein,Einstein’s belief that experience (action) leads to knowledge aligns with Krishna’s teaching—wisdom and action are two sides of the same coin.
5:6,"संन्यासस्तु महाबाहो दुःखमाप्तुमयोगतः |
योगयुक्तो मुनिर्ब्रह्म नचिरेणाधिगच्छति ॥५-६॥","O mighty-armed Arjuna, renunciation without yoga (selfless action) is difficult to achieve. But the wise one engaged in Karma Yoga swiftly attains Brahman.",Krishna explains that mere renunciation is challenging unless combined with action. True wisdom is achieved through Karma Yoga.,It is not enough to be busy; so are the ants. The question is: What are we busy about?,Henry David Thoreau,Thoreau’s words align with Krishna’s teaching—action should be purposeful and lead to enlightenment.
5:7,"योगयुक्तो विशुद्धात्मा विजितात्मा जितेन्द्रियः |
सर्वभूतात्मभूतात्मा कुर्वन्नपि न लिप्यते ॥५-७॥","One who is devoted to yoga, with a pure mind, self-controlled, and has mastery over the senses, remains unattached even while performing actions.","A true yogi remains untouched by karma’s effects, staying balanced and detached even while acting.",Self-control is strength. Right thought is mastery. Calmness is power.,James Allen,Krishna's teaching aligns with Allen’s view—mastery over the mind and senses leads to true strength.
5:8,"नैव किञ्चित्करोमीति युक्तो मन्येत तत्त्ववित् |
पश्यञ्शृण्वन्स्पृशञ्जिघ्रन्नश्नन्गच्छन्स्वपंश्वसन् ॥५-८॥","The wise one, who understands the truth, thinks, “I do nothing at all,” even while seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, walking, sleeping, and breathing.",Krishna emphasizes that selfless action arises from realizing that the soul is beyond bodily activities.,"Be like a lotus. Let the beauty of your heart speak. Be grateful to the mud, water, air, and the light.",Amit Ray,"Like a lotus remains untouched by water, Krishna teaches that a wise person remains unaffected by actions."

The universe is perfect and there are no failures.,Deepak Chopra,Krishna’s teaching matches Chopra’s—letting go of attachment to action leads to inner peace.
5:10,"ब्रह्मण्याधाय कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा करोति यः |
लिप्यते न स पापेन पद्मपत्रमिवाम्भसा ॥५-१०॥","One who performs all actions surrendering to the Supreme, abandoning attachment, is untouched by sin—just like a lotus leaf remains unstained by water.",Krishna highlights that actions performed in devotion remain free from karma’s bondage.,To love and be loved is to feel the sun from both sides.,David Viscott,Krishna's analogy of the lotus leaf reflects Viscott’s idea—living with devotion and detachment brings divine joy.
5:11,"कायेन मनसा बुद्ध्या केवलैरिन्द्रियैरपि |
योगिनः कर्म कुर्वन्ति सङ्गं त्यक्त्वाऽत्मशुद्धये ॥५-११॥","Yogis perform actions with the body, mind, intellect, and senses, abandoning attachment, for the purification of the self.","Krishna emphasizes selfless action—yogis engage in work without attachment, focusing on inner purity rather than outcomes.",Your work is to discover your work and then with all your heart to give yourself to it.,Buddha,"Just as Krishna teaches detachment in work, Buddha emphasizes wholehearted devotion to one’s purpose without attachment to results."

अयुक्तः कामकारेण फले सक्तो निबध्यते ॥५-१२॥","The wise person, renouncing the fruits of action, attains eternal peace, whereas the unwise, driven by desire, remains bound.","Renouncing results brings inner peace, whereas attachment to results leads to bondage and suffering.",Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.,Dalai Lama,"Krishna’s lesson on detachment aligns with the Dalai Lama’s insight—happiness arises from a peaceful mind, not external achievements."
5:13,"सर्वकर्माणि मनसा संन्यस्यास्ते सुखं वशी |
नवद्वारे पुरे देही नैव कुर्वन्न कारयन् ॥५-१३॥","The self-controlled person, renouncing all actions mentally, dwells happily in the city of nine gates (the body), neither acting nor causing action.",The enlightened person sees the body as a temporary dwelling and remains untouched by worldly distractions.,"You have power over your mind—not outside events.

Progress, not perfection, is the key to inner control.","Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.",Robert Collier,"Krishna’s emphasis on ""abhyasa"" (practice) resonates with Robert Collier’s view of success — steady effort, combined with a sense of detachment, ultimately leads to mastery."
6:36,"असंयतात्मना योगो दुष्प्राप इति मे मतिः ।
वश्यात्मना तु यतता शक्योऽवाप्तुमुपायतः ॥६-३६॥","Yoga is difficult to attain for one whose mind is unbridled, but it can be attained by one who has controlled the mind and strives earnestly using the right means.","Krishna points out that self-discipline is key to success in yoga. While an uncontrolled mind makes spiritual progress hard, steady effort combined with self-control opens the path to realization.",Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.,Jim Rohn,"Krishna’s focus on discipline as the means to attain yoga parallels Jim Rohn’s idea — without self-discipline, goals remain dreams, but with it, spiritual and worldly success becomes achievable."
6:37,"अर्जुन उवाच:
अयतिः श्रद्धयोपेतो योगाच्चलितमानसः ।
अप्राप्य योगसंसिद्धिं कां गतिं कृष्ण गच्छति ॥६-३७॥","Arjuna said: O Krishna, what is the fate of one who, though endowed with faith, strays from the path of yoga due to an unsteady mind and fails to attain perfection?","Arjuna voices a common fear — what happens if someone tries but falls short? This verse reflects human anxiety about spiritual failure, highlighting Arjuna’s concern for those who strive yet stumble.","Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.",Confucius,"Arjuna's fear of falling off the spiritual path mirrors the universal fear of failure. Confucius’ wisdom reassures that the real victory lies in persistence, aligning with Krishna’s upcoming reassurance."
6:38,"कच्चिन्नोभयविभ्रष्टश्छिन्नाभ्रमिव नश्यति ।
अप्रतिष्ठो महाबाहो विमूढो ब्रह्मणः पथि ॥६-३८॥","Does such a person, who deviates from yoga, perish like a broken cloud without any support, lost on the path of spirituality?","Arjuna uses the metaphor of a broken cloud to express his worry — does an incomplete spiritual seeker end up lost, gaining neither worldly success nor spiritual fulfillment?",Not all those who wander are lost.,J.R.R. Tolkien,"While Arjuna worries about lost seekers, Tolkien’s quote suggests that wandering doesn’t mean losing one’s way — Krishna will soon echo this idea, reassuring that no spiritual effort goes to waste."
6:39,"एतन्मे संशयं कृष्ण छेत्तुमर्हस्यशेषतः ।
त्वदन्यः संशयस्यास्य छेत्ता न ह्युपपद्यते ॥६-३९॥","O Krishna, please dispel this doubt of mine completely, for none other than You can destroy this uncertainty.",Arjuna acknowledges Krishna’s wisdom and pleads for clarity. This verse reflects the disciple’s trust in their teacher and the desire for spiritual certainty — a key moment of surrender and faith.,"Doubt is an uncomfortable condition, but certainty is a ridiculous one.",Voltaire,"While Arjuna seeks answers, Voltaire’s words remind us that questions are part of growth. Krishna doesn’t dismiss doubt but transforms it into a deeper understanding — embracing uncertainty as part of the journey."
6:40,"श्रीभगवानुवाच:
पार्थ नैवेह नामुत्र विनाशस्तस्य विद्यते ।
न हि कल्याणकृत्कश्चिद्दुर्गतिं तात गच्छति ॥६-४०॥","The Blessed Lord said: O Arjuna, there is no destruction for him either in this world or the next. One who strives for good never comes to grief.","Krishna reassures Arjuna that sincere spiritual efforts are never wasted. Even if a seeker stumbles, they carry forward their progress — no honest attempt is ever lost.",What we achieve inwardly will change outer reality.,Plutarch,Krishna’s message — that every spiritual effort counts — resonates with Plutarch’s belief that inner progress transforms the outer world. It’s a hopeful reminder that no sincere act of growth is futile.
6:41,"प्राप्य पुण्यकृतां लोकानुषित्वा शाश्वतीः समाः ।
शुचीनां श्रीमतां गेहे योगभ्रष्टोऽभिजायते ॥६-४१॥","Having attained the worlds of the righteous and dwelt there for countless years, the fallen yogi is born into a family of pure and prosperous individuals.","Krishna assures Arjuna that even those who fail to reach the ultimate goal of yoga in this life are rewarded. They are reborn in noble and spiritual families, giving them a favorable start for continuing their journey.","Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.",Winston Churchill,"Just as Churchill emphasizes perseverance, Krishna highlights that spiritual effort never ends in failure — it simply resumes in a more favorable environment in future lives."
6:42,"अथवा योगिनामेव कुले भवति धीमताम् ।
एतद्धि दुर्लभतरं लोके जन्म यदीदृशम् ॥६-४२॥","Or, he takes birth in a family of wise yogis. Such a birth is indeed rare and is obtained only by great fortune.",Krishna reveals that those with even greater spiritual merit are born into families of enlightened yogis. This privileged birth allows them to resume their path to liberation without much distraction.,"Not everyone can become great, but greatness can come from anywhere.",Anton Ego (Ratatouille),"Just as Krishna speaks about the rarity and significance of a spiritually advanced birth, this quote from Ratatouille reminds us that while spiritual excellence is rare, anyone can achieve greatness through consistent effort across lifetimes."
6:43,"तत्र तं बुद्धिसंयोगं लभते पौर्वदेहिकम् ।
यतते च ततो भूयः संसिद्धौ कुरुनन्दन ॥६-४३॥","There he regains the spiritual intelligence from his previous life, and again he strives towards perfection, O Arjuna.","This verse assures that spiritual wisdom from past lives is never lost. When born into a conducive family, the soul quickly reconnects with its previous knowledge and resumes its quest for self-realization.",Your past does not determine who you are. Your future is still unwritten.,Unknown,"While Krishna confirms that past spiritual effort shapes our present, this quote adds that every moment is a chance to write a new future, reinforcing the idea of continuous evolution across lifetimes."
6:44,"पूर्वाभ्यासेन तेनैव ह्रियते ह्यवशोऽपि सः ।
जिज्ञासुरपि योगस्य शब्दब्रह्मातिवर्तते ॥६-४४॥","By virtue of the practice of his previous life, he is irresistibly drawn towards yoga, even against his will. A seeker of yoga transcends the rituals prescribed in the scriptures.","Krishna reveals the magnetic pull of past spiritual practice — even if someone appears disconnected, their soul naturally gravitates back to yoga. Such a person transcends mere ritualistic religion and pursues deeper spiritual wisdom.",The call to adventure is in every soul.,Joseph Campbell,"Krishna’s words echo Joseph Campbell’s idea of an inner calling — the past practice of yoga stirs the soul, pushing one forward on their spiritual quest, just like every hero’s journey begins with a calling."
6:45,"प्रयत्नाद्यतमानस्तु योगी संशुद्धकिल्बिषः ।
अनेकजन्मसंसिद्धस्ततो याति परां गतिम् ॥६-४५॥","But the yogi who strives with great effort, purified of all sins, attains the highest goal after many births.","Krishna emphasizes that spiritual mastery doesn’t happen overnight — it takes many lifetimes of sincere effort. Ultimately, however, such a dedicated yogi achieves the supreme goal of liberation.",Great things are not done by impulse but by a series of small things brought together.,Vincent van Gogh,"Krishna’s reminder about sustained effort mirrors Van Gogh’s philosophy — just as spiritual liberation is a culmination of steady practice across lifetimes, great achievements in art or life arise from consistent, patient effort."
6:46,"तपस्विभ्योऽधिको योगी ज्ञानिभ्योऽपि मतोऽधिकः ।
कर्मिभ्यश्चाधिको योगी तस्माद्योगी भवार्जुन ॥६-४६॥","The yogi is superior to ascetics, greater than the wise, and surpasses those performing mere rituals. Therefore, O Arjuna, be a yogi!","Krishna declares the supremacy of a yogi’s path. While ascetics renounce the world and scholars pursue knowledge, a yogi transcends both by combining devotion, wisdom, and action. This verse emphasizes that true spiritual practice lies in disciplined union with the divine, not just in external rituals or intellectual pursuits.",Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.,Jim Rohn,"Krishna's call to Arjuna mirrors Jim Rohn’s message — being a yogi requires steadfast discipline and devotion, combining the strengths of knowledge, action, and spiritual focus to reach true fulfillment."
6:47,"योगिनामपि सर्वेषां मद्गतेनान्तरात्मना ।
श्रद्धावान्भजते यो मां स मे युक्ततमो मतः ॥६-४७॥","Among all yogis, the one who worships Me with faith, his inner self absorbed in Me, is considered by Me to be the most devoted.","In this concluding verse of Chapter 6, Krishna identifies the highest yogi as one whose heart and mind are wholly immersed in the divine. Faith and devotion, coupled with spiritual practice, elevate a yogi to the ultimate level — full union with the divine.",Faith is taking the first step even when you don’t see the whole staircase.,Martin Luther King Jr.,"Krishna's teaching aligns with MLK’s wisdom — the greatest yogi is not just one who practices but one who moves forward in faith, completely absorbed in the divine, even without seeing the final outcome."
7:1,"श्रीभगवानुवाच —
मय्यासक्तमना: पार्थ योगं युञ्जन्मदाश्रय: ।

With your mind attached to Me, O Arjuna, and practicing yoga under My protection, you shall know Me completely and without doubt.",Krishna opens this chapter by inviting Arjuna to focus his mind on the divine. He emphasizes that true knowledge comes when one practices yoga with unwavering devotion and seeks divine shelter. This sets the tone for realizing both Krishna’s material and spiritual manifestations.,"Where focus goes, energy flows.",Tony Robbins,Krishna’s guidance mirrors Tony Robbins’ principle — directing one’s full focus on the divine leads to deeper understanding and spiritual clarity.
7:2,"ज्ञानं तेऽहं सविज्ञानमिदं वक्ष्याम्यशेषत: ।
यज्ज्ञात्वा नेह भूयोऽन्यज्ज्ञातव्यमवशिष्यते ॥७-२॥","I shall now fully explain to you this knowledge and wisdom, knowing which nothing more remains to be known in this world.","Krishna promises to impart both jnana (theoretical knowledge) and vijnana (experiential wisdom). He highlights that realizing this complete wisdom will leave no mystery unsolved, illuminating the ultimate truth.",Knowledge is of no value unless you put it into practice.,Anton Chekhov,"Like Krishna’s distinction between knowledge and wisdom, Chekhov emphasizes that true understanding comes not from theory alone but from lived experience — aligning with Krishna’s notion of vijnana."
7:3,"मनुष्याणां सहस्रेषु कश्चिद्यतति सिद्धये ।
यततामपि सिद्धानां कश्चिन्मां वेत्ति तत्त्वत: ॥७-३॥","Among thousands of men, one may strive for perfection; and among those who strive and succeed, hardly one knows Me in truth.","Krishna acknowledges the rarity of true spiritual realization. While many pursue spiritual goals, few attain full enlightenment and even fewer truly comprehend the divine nature of Krishna.","The path to success is to take massive, determined action.",Tony Robbins,"Krishna's message about rare spiritual attainment parallels Tony Robbins’ call for relentless effort — both suggest that only a dedicated few reach the pinnacle of their pursuit, whether spiritual or worldly."
7:4,"भूमिरापोऽनलो वायुः खं मनो बुद्धिरेव च ।
अहङ्कार इतीयं मे भिन्ना प्रकृतिरष्टधा ॥७-४॥","Earth, water, fire, air, space, mind, intellect, and ego — these constitute My eightfold separated material energies.","Krishna introduces His material energy, listing the five elements (earth, water, fire, air, and space) and three subtle aspects (mind, intellect, and ego). These eight components form the foundation of the material universe, highlighting the divine's control over creation.",Energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be changed from one form to another.,Albert Einstein,"Einstein’s law of energy transformation echoes Krishna’s teaching — the elements and energies Krishna describes form the building blocks of the universe, underscoring a timeless scientific-spiritual truth."
7:5,"अपरेयमितस्त्वन्यां प्रकृतिं विद्धि मे पराम् ।
जीवभूतां महाबाहो ययेदं धार्यते जगत् ॥७-५॥","Beyond this inferior material nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, know My superior energy — the living entities — by which this world is sustained.","Krishna contrasts His lower material energy with His higher, spiritual energy — the jiva (living beings). This verse highlights that the soul, as part of Krishna’s divine energy, sustains the universe and transcends mere material existence.",You are not a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop.,Rumi,"Rumi’s words reflect Krishna’s teaching — the soul (jiva) contains divine essence, underscoring the spiritual reality that all beings hold a spark of the divine within them."
7:6,"एतद्योनीनि भूतानि सर्वाणीत्युपधारय ।
अहं कृत्स्नस्य जगतः प्रभवः प्रलयस्तथा ॥७-६॥",Understand that all living beings have their source in these two natures. I am the origin of the entire universe and also its dissolution.,"Krishna reveals that all creation stems from His two natures — material (lower) and spiritual (higher). He declares Himself the source of both the beginning and end of the universe, reinforcing the idea that He governs all cosmic cycles.","Everything comes from something, and something comes from nothing.",Craig D. Lounsbrough,"This echoes Krishna's teaching — all beings arise from His divine energy, showing that existence has both a visible material cause and an unseen spiritual source."
7:7,"मत्त: परतरं नान्यत्किञ्चिदस्ति धनञ्जय ।
मयि सर्वमिदं प्रोतं सूत्रे मणिगणा इव ॥७-७॥","O Arjuna, there is nothing higher than Me.

While material forms appear separate, they are all connected through Krishna’s divine presence.",God is the thread that ties us all together.,Unknown,"Krishna’s metaphor of pearls on a string beautifully conveys the unity underlying diversity, a concept mirrored by spiritual ideas of interconnectedness across traditions."
7:8,"रसोऽहमप्सु कौन्तेय प्रभास्मि शशिसूर्ययो: ।
प्रणव: सर्ववेदेषु शब्द: खे पौरुषं नृषु ॥७-८॥","I am the taste in water, O son of Kunti, the light of the sun and moon, the sacred syllable Om in the Vedas, sound in the ether, and ability in men.","Krishna identifies Himself with the essence of all things — the taste of water, the brilliance of celestial bodies, the eternal Om of the Vedas, and human strength. He shows that His presence pervades every aspect of the universe.",God is not in a place — He is every place.,Maya Angelou,"Krishna's teaching resonates with Angelou’s quote — divinity isn’t confined to temples but exists in the simplest experiences, like water’s taste or the sun’s light."
7:9,"पुण्यो गन्ध: पृथिव्यां च तेजश्चास्मि विभावसौ ।
जीवनं सर्वभूतेषु तपश्चास्मि तपस्विषु ॥७-९॥",I am the pure fragrance of the earth and the brilliance in fire. I am the life in all living beings and the penance of the ascetics.,"Krishna explains His divine immanence by linking Himself to nature's elements — the scent of the earth, the heat of fire, and the very essence of life itself. He also embodies spiritual discipline, emphasizing His role in both the material and spiritual realms.",Nature is the art of God.,Dante Alighieri,"Just as Dante views nature as God’s art, Krishna highlights how His divine essence is manifest in every natural element, reinforcing the sacredness of the world around us."
7:10,"बीजं मां सर्वभूतानां विद्धि पार्थ सनातनम् ।
बुद्धिर्बुद्धिमतामस्मि तेजस्तेजस्विनामहम् ॥७-१०॥","O Arjuna, know Me as the eternal seed of all beings. I am the intelligence of the intelligent and the splendor of the splendid.",Krishna presents Himself as the eternal seed — the source of all creation. He further explains that intelligence and brilliance in any being are reflections of His divine qualities. This verse deepens the idea that every ability stems from the divine.,Within you is the light of a thousand suns.,Robert Adams,"Robert Adams' quote aligns with Krishna’s message — all intelligence, strength, and brilliance come from the divine spark within each being, reinforcing our shared spiritual origin."
7:11,"बलं बलवतां चाहं कामरागविवर्जितम् ।
धर्माविरुद्धो भूतेषु कामोऽस्मि भरतर्षभ ॥७-११॥","I am the strength of the strong, devoid of desire and attachment. O Arjuna, I am the desire in beings that is in accordance with dharma.","Krishna clarifies that He represents pure strength — not driven by selfishness — and righteous desire rooted in duty (dharma). This verse suggests that even desire, when aligned with higher principles, is divine.",Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will.,Mahatma Gandhi,"Krishna's teaching resonates with Gandhi's quote — strength rooted in discipline and virtue mirrors Krishna's idea of divine, desire-free power."

मत्त एवेति तान्विद्धि न त्वहं तेषु ते मयि ॥७-१२॥","Whatever states of being arise — whether they are sattvic (pure), rajasic (passionate), or tamasic (ignorant) — know that they come from Me. However, I am not in them; they are in Me.","Krishna reveals that all modes of material nature — purity, passion, and ignorance — originate from Him, yet He transcends them. He is their source but remains unaffected by their influences.",You are not a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop.,Rumi,"Krishna’s transcendence over these states parallels Rumi’s idea — while we may embody different qualities, the divine essence remains whole and untainted."
7:13,"त्रिभिर्गुणमयैर्भावैरेभिः सर्वमिदं जगत् ।
मोहितं नाभिजानाति मामेभ्यः परमव्ययम् ॥७-१३॥","Deluded by these three modes of nature, the entire world fails to recognize Me, who am beyond them and imperishable.","Krishna explains that the world, influenced by material modes (gunas), cannot perceive His true, unchanging nature. Attachment to these modes creates a veil over divine reality.","Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.",Albert Einstein,"Einstein’s idea of illusion aligns with Krishna’s teaching — the material world’s appearances often obscure the eternal, transcendent truth behind it."
7:14,"दैवी ह्येषा गुणमयी मम माया दुरत्यया ।
मामेव ये प्रपद्यन्ते मायामेतां तरन्ति ते ॥७-१४॥","This divine illusion of Mine, composed of the three modes of nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who surrender to Me cross beyond it.","Krishna introduces maya — the powerful illusion rooted in material nature. Though it binds beings, He assures that surrendering to Him allows one to transcend it.",Surrender is the most powerful tool to connect with the divine.,Deepak Chopra,"Like Krishna's message, Chopra emphasizes that true freedom lies in surrender — only by letting go of ego can one overcome illusion and unite with the divine."
7:15,"न मां दुष्कृतिनो मूढाः प्रपद्यन्ते नराधमाः ।
माययापहृतज्ञाना आसुरं भावमाश्रिताः ॥७-१५॥","The deluded, the wicked, the lowest of men — those whose knowledge is stolen by illusion and who embrace demonic natures — do not surrender to Me.","Krishna highlights that those trapped by maya, corrupted by arrogance or ignorance, are unable to seek Him. Their clouded intellect prevents them from realizing the divine.",Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own unguarded thoughts.,Buddha,Krishna's teaching mirrors Buddha's insight — internal delusion (maya) is a greater obstacle than any external force. True growth begins by overcoming inner ignorance.
7:16,"चतुर्विधा भजन्ते मां जनाः सुकृतिनोऽर्जुन ।
आर्तो जिज्ञासुरर्थार्थी ज्ञानी च भरतर्षभ ॥७-१६॥","O Arjuna, four kinds of pious people worship Me — the distressed, the seeker of knowledge, the seeker of wealth, and the wise.","Krishna explains the four types of devotees who turn to Him: those seeking relief from suffering, those craving knowledge, those desiring material gains, and those who are wise and self-realized. Each approaches the divine for different reasons, yet all take a step towards Him.",Not all who wander are lost.,J.R.R. Tolkien,"Just as Krishna acknowledges diverse paths to devotion, Tolkien's quote reminds us that every journey — be it in search of relief, answers, or truth — holds meaning."
7:17,"तेषां ज्ञानी नित्ययुक्त एकभक्तिर्विशिष्यते ।
प्रियो हि ज्ञानिनोऽत्यर्थमहं स च मम प्रियः ॥७-१७॥","Among them, the wise one who is always united with Me through exclusive devotion excels. I am very dear to him, and he is dear to Me.","Krishna reveals that although all four types of devotees are virtuous, the wise devotee — who loves and worships Him with pure, unwavering devotion — holds a special place in His heart. This verse underscores the unique bond between wisdom and heartfelt surrender.","Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.",William Shakespeare,"Just as Krishna honors the selfless devotion of the wise, Shakespeare's words echo a similar sentiment — genuine love and loyalty transcend all."
7:18,"उदारा: सर्व एवैते ज्ञानी त्वात्मैव मे मतम् ।
आस्थित: स हि युक्तात्मा मामेवानुत्तमां गतिम् ॥७-१८॥","All these are indeed noble, but the wise one, who is steadfast in devotion, is like My very self. Such a person is firmly established in Me and attains the highest goal.","Krishna acknowledges the merit of all who seek Him but reiterates that the wise, devoted soul reflects His own nature. By aligning their consciousness with Him, they reach the supreme spiritual destination.",What you seek is seeking you.,Rumi,This Rumi quote parallels Krishna’s idea — the wise devotee's quest for the divine mirrors the divine’s love for the devotee. It’s a reciprocal bond of spiritual unity.
7:19,"बहूनां जन्मनामन्ते ज्ञानवान्मां प्रपद्यते ।
वासुदेव: सर्वमिति स महात्मा सुदुर्लभ: ॥७-१९॥","After many births, the wise person surrenders to Me, realizing that I — Vasudeva — am everything. Such a great soul is indeed very rare.",Krishna highlights the long spiritual journey of the enlightened soul. Only after lifetimes of seeking does one grasp the ultimate truth — that the divine pervades all. This rare realization brings complete surrender and liberation.,It takes a long time to become young.,Pablo Picasso,"Picasso’s quote reflects Krishna's message — true wisdom is a gradual unfolding process, often taking lifetimes, until one returns to the pure simplicity of divine understanding."
7:20,"कामैस्तैस्तैर्हृतज्ञानाः प्रपद्यन्तेऽन्यदेवताः ।
तं तं नियममास्थाय प्रकृत्या नियताः स्वया ॥७-२०॥","Those whose knowledge is stolen by material desires worship other deities, following specific rules and driven by their own nature.","Krishna explains that those entangled in worldly desires often turn to lesser gods, seeking specific boons or results. Their devotion, though sincere, is shaped by their material cravings rather than the pursuit of ultimate truth.","You can’t always get what you want. But if you try sometimes, you just might find, you get what you need.",The Rolling Stones,"Like Krishna’s words, this quote reminds us that desires often cloud our judgment, leading us to seek fleeting solutions instead of deeper truths. Real fulfillment lies beyond material wants."
7:21,"यो यो यां यां तनुं भक्तः श्रद्धयार्चितुमिच्छति ।
तस्य तस्याचलां श्रद्धां तामेव विदधाम्यहम् ॥७-२१॥","Whatever form a devotee desires to worship with faith, I make that faith steady so that he can devote himself to that form.","Krishna acknowledges the sincerity of all worship. Regardless of the deity or form chosen, it is ultimately He who strengthens the devotee’s faith. This highlights His all-encompassing nature and the inclusivity of spiritual practices.",Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase.,Martin Luther King Jr.,"Just as Krishna nurtures the faith of all worshippers, Martin Luther King Jr.'s quote underscores how faith sustains and propels us forward, even when the full path remains unseen."
7:22,"स तया श्रद्धया युक्तस्तस्याराधनमीहते ।
लभते च ततः कामान्मयैव विहितान्हि तान् ॥७-२२॥","Endowed with that faith, he strives to worship his chosen deity and obtains his desires. But in reality, those benefits are granted by Me alone.","Krishna reveals that while devotees may attribute their gains to various deities, it is ultimately His divine will that fulfills their desires. He is the source behind all results, whether recognized or not.","All the gods, all the heavens, all the hells, are within you.",Joseph Campbell,"This aligns with Krishna's teaching — deities are but manifestations of the One divine source. Every gain, though appearing separate, flows from the same universal power."
7:23,"अन्तवत्तु फलं तेषां तद्भवत्यल्पमेधसाम् ।
देवान्देवयजो यान्ति मद्भक्ता यान्ति मामपि ॥७-२३॥","The fruits gained by these less intelligent people are temporary. Those who worship the gods go to the gods, but My devotees come to Me.","Krishna differentiates between temporary and eternal rewards. Worshiping deities for worldly desires brings fleeting results, but those devoted to Krishna directly attain the everlasting divine union.",Do not be satisfied with the stories that come before you. Unfold your own myth.,Rumi,"Just as Krishna urges seekers to aim beyond temporary gains, Rumi's words push us to transcend surface-level desires, seeking the deeper spiritual truth."
7:24,"अव्यक्तं व्यक्तिमापन्नं मन्यन्ते मामबुद्धयः ।
परं भावमजानन्तो ममाव्ययमनुत्तमम् ॥७-२४॥","The ignorant think of Me as having assumed a form, not knowing My higher, immutable, and supreme existence.","Krishna highlights the limited understanding of those who view Him merely as a physical entity. His true nature transcends form — eternal, formless, and infinite — yet many fail to recognize this ultimate reality.",The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend.,Robertson Davies,Krishna’s point reflects this idea — limited perception results in a limited understanding of the divine. True wisdom requires seeing beyond appearances.
7:25,"नाहं प्रकाशः सर्वस्य योगमायासमावृतः ।
मूढोऽयं नाभिजानाति लोको मामजमव्ययम् ॥७-२५॥","I am not manifest to everyone, veiled by My divine Yoga-Maya. The ignorant do not recognize Me as unborn and eternal.","Krishna explains that His true essence remains hidden, concealed by His mystical power (Yoga-Maya). Those with limited insight cannot grasp His timeless, unchanging nature. Only through deep spiritual practice can one pierce this veil.","The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.",Marcel Proust,"Just as Krishna describes the hidden nature of divinity, Proust reminds us that true understanding doesn’t come from looking outward but from deepening our perception."
7:26,"वेदाहं समतीतानि वर्तमानानि चार्जुन ।
भविष्याणि च भूतानि मां तु वेद न कश्चन ॥७-२६॥","I know all beings, past, present, and future, O Arjuna, but no one truly knows Me.","Krishna reveals His omniscience — He is aware of everything that has happened, is happening, and will happen. However, because of Maya (illusion), people fail to recognize His true, eternal nature.",The past is never dead. It's not even past.,William Faulkner,"Like Krishna’s timeless awareness, Faulkner’s words reflect the idea that time is interconnected — past, present, and future coexist, just as Krishna knows them all simultaneously."
7:27,"इच्छाद्वेषसमुत्थेन द्वन्द्वमोहेन भारत ।
सर्वभूतानि सम्मोहं सर्गे यान्ति परन्तप ॥७-२७॥","O Arjuna, all beings are born into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desire and aversion.","Krishna highlights that every soul, from birth, is entangled in dualities — like pleasure and pain, love and hate. These polarities cloud judgment, preventing people from seeing their divine essence.",Freedom is the absence of choice.,Jiddu Krishnamurti,"Krishna’s teaching aligns with Krishnamurti's idea — true freedom arises when we transcend the constant push and pull of opposites, moving beyond desire and aversion."
7:28,"येषां त्वन्तगतं पापं जनानां पुण्यकर्मणाम् ।
ते द्वन्द्वमोहनिर्मुक्ता भजन्ते मां दृढव्रताः ॥७-२८॥","Those who have freed themselves from sin through righteous actions and are released from the illusion of duality, worship Me with firm resolve.","Krishna teaches that spiritual clarity comes to those who purify themselves with good deeds. Free from confusion caused by dualities, they can dedicate themselves unwaveringly to the divine.","Your beliefs become your thoughts, your thoughts become your words, your words become your actions.",Mahatma Gandhi,"Like Krishna's point about righteous actions leading to spiritual liberation, Gandhi emphasizes how internal purity shapes outer actions and, ultimately, one’s path to freedom."
7:29,"जरामरणमोक्षाय मामाश्रित्य यतन्ति ये ।
ते ब्रह्म तद्विदुः कृत्स्नमध्यात्मं कर्म चाखिलम् ॥७-२९॥","Those who strive for liberation from old age and death, taking refuge in Me, know the Brahman, the self, and the entire field of action.","Krishna explains that sincere seekers who yearn for liberation — freedom from the cycle of birth and death — come to understand the ultimate truths of Brahman (the absolute), the soul, and karma.","Death is not the opposite of life, but a part of it.",Haruki Murakami,"This mirrors Krishna's message: true seekers grasp that transcending death means understanding it as a phase in the soul’s eternal journey, not an end."
7:30,"साधिभूताधिदैवं मां साधियज्ञं च ये विदुः ।
प्रयाणकालेऽपि च मां ते विदुर्युक्तचेतसः ॥७-३०॥","Those who know Me as the Lord of all beings, the ruler of gods, and the master of all sacrifices, with minds steadfast even at the time of death, truly understand Me.","Krishna asserts that those who recognize Him as the Supreme Being — the source of creation, gods, and all spiritual practices — and keep their focus unwavering, even at the moment of death, achieve ultimate union with Him.",He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.,Friedrich Nietzsche,"Krishna’s teaching parallels Nietzsche’s idea: those with a clear, divine purpose can endure any challenge — including death — knowing they move toward spiritual liberation."
8:1,"अर्जुन उवाच ।
किं तद्ब्रह्म किमध्यात्मं किं कर्म पुरुषोत्तम ।

What is the material manifestation, and what is the divine realm?","Arjuna, eager to grasp deeper spiritual concepts, questions Krishna about the nature of Brahman (the Absolute), the individual soul (adhyatma), karma (action), the physical world (adhibhuta), and divine forces (adhidaiva). These inquiries set the stage for a profound discourse on ultimate reality.","True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life, ourselves, and the world around us.",Socrates,"Just as Arjuna seeks clarity about life’s fundamental truths, Socrates' quote reflects the same yearning for deeper understanding — recognizing that wisdom begins with questioning."
8:2,"अधियज्ञः कथं कोऽत्र देहेऽस्मिन्मधुसूदन ।
प्रयाणकाले च कथं ज्ञेयोऽसि नियतात्मभिः ॥८-२॥","O Krishna, who is the Lord of sacrifice in the body, and how does He reside there? And how are You to be known at the time of death by the self-controlled?","Arjuna now probes the connection between the divine (adhiyajna) and the physical body, as well as how to remember God at the moment of death — a pivotal question leading to Krishna's explanation of spiritual practice and death’s significance.",The soul is dyed with the color of its thoughts.,Marcus Aurelius,Marcus Aurelius’ words echo Krishna's teachings: the state of one’s mind at death (colored by thoughts and actions) shapes the soul’s journey forward — reinforcing mindfulness and spiritual focus.
8:3,"श्रीभगवानुवाच ।
अक्षरं ब्रह्म परमं स्वभावोऽध्यात्ममुच्यते ।
भूतभावोद्भवकरो विसर्गः कर्मसंज्ञितः ॥८-३॥","The Blessed Lord said: The eternal, imperishable Brahman is the Supreme. The self (adhyatma) is one's own nature, and karma is the creative force that brings beings into existence.","Krishna answers Arjuna by defining core concepts: Brahman as the unchanging ultimate reality, adhyatma as the soul’s true nature, and karma as the force of action shaping the cycle of birth and rebirth.","Change is the law of life, and those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future.",John F. Kennedy,"Karma embodies constant change through cause and effect. Like Krishna’s definition, JFK highlights how change is an unstoppable law — aligning with karma’s dynamic role in shaping existence."
8:4,"अधिभूतं क्षरो भावः पुरुषश्चाधिदैवतम् ।
अधियज्ञोऽहमेवात्र देहे देहभृतां वर ॥८-४॥","The physical realm (adhibhuta) is the perishable nature. The divine (adhidaiva) is the cosmic spirit. I am the Lord of all sacrifices (adhiyajna), dwelling within the body, O best of embodied beings.","Krishna clarifies how the physical world, divine forces, and sacrifices connect. While the body and material world are temporary, He, as the Supreme Being, resides within all beings, guiding their spiritual journeys.",Within you is the light of a thousand suns.,Robert Adams,"This quote reflects Krishna’s message — the divine (adhiyajna) is not a distant force but an inner presence, burning bright within each soul, waiting to be realized."
8:5,"अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन्मुक्त्वा कलेवरम् ।
यः प्रयाति स मद्भावं याति नास्त्यत्र संशयः ॥८-५॥","And whoever, at the time of death, remembers Me alone while leaving the body, attains My being — of this there is no doubt.","Krishna stresses the importance of one’s final thoughts at the moment of death. If a person dies with their mind fixed solely on Him, they merge into His divine nature — promising eternal union with the Supreme.","What we think, we become.",Buddha,Krishna’s teaching mirrors Buddha’s wisdom: a soul’s destiny hinges on its last thoughts — what occupies the mind in life shapes the journey beyond death.

8:6,"यं यं वापि स्मरन्भावं त्यजत्यन्ते कलेवरम् ।
तं तमेवैति कौन्तेय सदा तद्भावभावितः ॥८-६॥","Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, O son of Kunti, that state he will attain without fail.",Krishna emphasizes the law of attraction at the time of death — the final thoughts and emotions one holds shape the soul's next journey. This reinforces the importance of constant spiritual mindfulness.,"Your mind is a powerful thing. When you fill it with positive thoughts, your life will start to change.",Anonymous,Krishna’s teaching mirrors this idea: the mind's focus at the crucial moment of death determines one's next existence — a spiritual continuation of the law of attraction.
8:7,"तस्मात्सर्वेषु कालेषु मामनुस्मर युध्य च ।
मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्मामेवैष्यस्यसंशयः ॥८-७॥","Therefore, think of Me at all times and fight. With your mind and intellect surrendered to Me, you will surely come to Me. There is no doubt about it.",Krishna advises Arjuna to engage in his duties (like fighting) while keeping his mind fixed on God. This verse teaches balance — fulfilling worldly responsibilities while maintaining spiritual focus.,Work as if everything depends on you. Pray as if everything depends on God.,St. Ignatius,"Just like Krishna's message, this quote highlights the harmony between action and devotion — perform your duties wholeheartedly but keep your mind anchored in God."
8:8,"अभ्यासयोगयुक्तेन चेतसा नान्यगामिना ।
परमं पुरुषं दिव्यं याति पार्थानुचिन्तयन् ॥८-८॥","By practicing meditation with an unwavering mind and focusing on the Divine Supreme, one surely attains Him, O son of Pritha.",Krishna emphasizes Abhyasa Yoga — the discipline of consistent meditation and concentration on the Supreme Being — as the path to uniting with God.,"Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.",Robert Collier,"Just as Krishna highlights constant spiritual practice, Collier reminds us that success — whether worldly or spiritual — stems from steady, focused efforts over time."
8:9,"कविं पुराणमनुशासितार
मणोरणीयंसमनुस्मरेद्यः ।
सर्वस्य धातारमचिन्त्यरूप
मादित्यवर्णं तमसः परस्तात् ॥८-९॥","He who meditates on the omniscient, ancient, and all-controlling Supreme Lord — smaller than the smallest and the supporter of all — who is beyond darkness and glowing like the sun — will surely attain Him.","Krishna paints a vivid picture of the Divine as all-knowing, eternal, and ever-radiant — urging Arjuna to meditate on this cosmic form.","The sun does not shine for a few trees and flowers, but for the wide world’s joy.",Henry Ward Beecher,"Just as Krishna likens the Divine to the sun — illuminating all — Beecher’s quote reflects God’s impartial, radiant presence that supports every being, big or small."
8:10,"प्रयाणकाले मनसाचलेन
भक्त्या युक्तो योगबलेन चैव ।
भ्रुवोर्मध्ये प्राणमावेश्य सम्यक्
स तं परं पुरुषमुपैति दिव्यम् ॥८-१०॥","At the time of death, with a steady mind full of devotion, by the power of yoga, and focusing the life force between the eyebrows, one attains the Supreme Divine.","Krishna describes the final moments of a yogi: with unwavering focus, heart full of faith, and mastering prana (life force), one merges with the Divine.","The body is the bow, the asana is the arrow, and the soul is the target.",B.K.S. Iyengar,"Just as Krishna illustrates mastering the body, breath, and mind to reach God, Iyengar’s words capture the same essence — spiritual realization requires focused alignment of physical, mental, and spiritual forces."
8:11,"यदक्षरं वेदविदो वदन्ति
विशन्ति यद्यतयो वीतरागाः ।
यदिच्छन्तो ब्रह्मचर्यं चरन्ति
तत्ते पदं सङ्ग्रहेण प्रवक्ष्ये ॥८-११॥","I will now explain to you briefly that goal which the knowers of the Vedas call the Imperishable, which the ascetics enter free from attachments, and desiring which, they practice celibacy.","Krishna introduces the concept of the Akshara Brahman — the eternal, unchanging reality that Vedic scholars and renunciates strive to realize. This verse highlights the need for detachment and discipline in the spiritual quest.","Detachment is not that you should own nothing, but that nothing should own you.",Ali Ibn Abi Talib,"Just like Krishna speaks of freeing oneself from attachments to attain the eternal, this quote emphasizes the same — spirituality does not mean having nothing but ensuring nothing controls you."
8:12,"सर्वद्वाराणि संयम्य मनो हृदि निरुध्य च ।
मूर्ध्न्याधायात्मनः प्राणमास्थितो योगधारणाम् ॥८-१२॥","Restraining all the gates of the body, confining the mind in the heart, and fixing the life force in the head, established in yogic concentration — this is the way.","Krishna reveals a deep yogic practice — controlling senses (gates), focusing the mind, and guiding prana (life force) upward through the chakras — a crucial step to attaining divine realization.",Mastering others is strength. Mastering yourself is true power.,Lao Tzu,"Krishna’s teaching of self-restraint and inner focus mirrors Lao Tzu’s wisdom — spiritual strength comes from mastering the mind and body, not just the external world."
8:13,"ओमित्येकाक्षरं ब्रह्म व्याहरन्मामनुस्मरन् ।
यः प्रयाति त्यजन्देहं स याति परमां गतिम् ॥८-१३॥","Uttering the single syllable ""Om,"" which is Brahman, and remembering Me, he who departs, giving up his body, attains the Supreme Goal.",Krishna emphasizes the divine power of Om — the universal sound representing Brahman — and how chanting it while remembering God leads to liberation at death.,The sound of 'Om' is the primordial sound of the universe — the heartbeat of existence.,Anonymous,"Just as Krishna highlights Om as the path to the Supreme, the quote reflects the cosmic significance of this sound — uniting all creation with the Divine."
8:14,"अनन्यचेताः सततं यो मां स्मरति नित्यशः ।
तस्याहं सुलभः पार्थ नित्ययुक्तस्य योगिनः ॥८-१४॥","For one who remembers Me without deviation, constantly and with an undivided mind, I am easily attainable, O Arjuna, for that steadfast yogi.","Krishna reassures that constant, unwavering devotion (ananya bhakti) makes union with Him simple and certain — for the one fully absorbed in His thoughts, He is ever near.","Wherever you are, be all there.",Jim Elliot,Krishna’s call for focused devotion aligns with Elliot’s wisdom — true spiritual progress happens when your heart and mind remain entirely devoted to the present moment and to God.
8:15,"मामुपेत्य पुनर्जन्म दुःखालयमशाश्वतम् ।
नाप्नुवन्ति महात्मानः संसिद्धिं परमां गताः ॥८-१५॥","Having attained Me, the great souls never return to this temporary world, which is full of suffering, because they have reached the highest perfection.","Krishna explains the ultimate goal — once a soul reaches Him, there is no more rebirth into the transient world of sorrow. The liberated ones dwell eternally in divine bliss.","Once you awaken, you will have no interest in judging those who sleep.",James Blanchard,"Just as Krishna describes the liberated soul never returning to the cycle of suffering, Blanchard’s words reflect the same transcendence — awakened souls rise above worldly entanglements and suffering."
8:16,"आ ब्रह्मभुवनाल्लोकाः पुनरावर्तिनोऽर्जुन ।
मामुपेत्य तु कौन्तेय पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते ॥८-१६॥","All the worlds, including the realm of Brahma, are subject to rebirth, O Arjuna. But one who attains Me is never born again.",Krishna reveals that even the highest material realms are bound by the cycle of creation and destruction. True liberation (moksha) lies only in reaching Him — transcending all cycles of rebirth.,"Freedom is not the absence of commitments, but the ability to choose — and commit to — what is best for you.",Paulo Coelho,"Just as Krishna speaks about transcending worldly cycles, Coelho’s quote reminds us that real freedom lies in conscious choice — choosing the spiritual over the material leads to true liberation."
8:17,"सहस्रयुगपर्यन्तमहर्यद्ब्रह्मणो विदुः ।
रात्रिं युगसहस्रान्तां तेऽहोरात्रविदो जनाः ॥८-१७॥","Those who know the day of Brahma, which lasts a thousand Yugas, and the night which also lasts a thousand Yugas, understand the true nature of time.","Krishna introduces cosmic time — Brahma’s day and night span thousands of Yugas (eras), underscoring the vastness of creation’s cycles and how fleeting human lifetimes are in comparison.",Time is a created thing. To say 'I don't have time' is like saying 'I don't want to'.,Lao Tzu,"While Krishna explains time’s cosmic scale, Lao Tzu’s wisdom highlights a personal truth — time is what we make of it. Krishna urges us to rise above temporal limitations."
8:18,"अव्यक्ताद्व्यक्तयः सर्वाः प्रभवन्त्यहरागमे ।
रात्र्यागमे प्रलीयन्ते तत्रैवाव्यक्तसंज्ञके ॥८-१८॥","At the dawn of Brahma's day, all living beings manifest from the unmanifest; at the fall of night, they merge into that which is called the unmanifest again.","Krishna reveals the universe’s cyclical nature — creation and dissolution repeat endlessly, with all beings emerging and dissolving into the unmanifest reality (Avyakta).","Everything comes from nothing, and nothing returns to everything.",Anonymous,"Krishna’s teaching about creation and dissolution reflects this quote’s essence — existence flows in cycles, and spiritual wisdom lies in realizing the impermanence of material forms."
8:19,"भूतग्रामः स एवायं भूत्वा भूत्वा प्रलीयते ।
रात्र्यागमेऽवशः पार्थ प्रभवत्यहरागमे ॥८-१९॥","This multitude of beings repeatedly comes into existence at the arrival of Brahma's day and is again annihilated at Brahma's night, helplessly bound by the laws of nature.","Krishna emphasizes that all beings are subject to this cosmic rhythm, helplessly caught in the cycle of birth and death until they transcend through spiritual wisdom.","Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.",Lao Tzu,"Just as Krishna speaks of the steady, inevitable cycles of creation, Lao Tzu reminds us of nature’s pace — slow but certain — mirroring the universe’s unceasing rhythm."

यः स सर्वेषु भूतेषु नश्यत्सु न विनश्यति ॥८-२०॥","Beyond this unmanifest state is another eternal unmanifest existence, which does not perish when all beings cease to exist.","Krishna reveals a higher, eternal reality (Sanatana), beyond even the cycles of cosmic creation and destruction — the supreme, unchanging spiritual realm.","There is a reality beyond this reality, and within that lies the eternal truth.",Rumi,Krishna’s mention of the imperishable realm echoes Rumi’s wisdom — both point towards an unchanging spiritual existence beyond the physical and material worlds.
8:21,"अव्यक्तोऽक्षर इत्युक्तस्तमाहुः परमां गतिम् ।
यं प्राप्य न निवर्तन्ते तद्धाम परमं मम ॥८-२१॥","That which is called the unmanifest and the imperishable is the supreme goal. Having attained it, one never returns. That is My supreme abode.","Krishna explains that the ultimate goal is to reach the Avyakta — the unmanifest, eternal reality. Once a soul unites with this supreme state, it is freed from the cycle of rebirth.",True peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.,Buddha,"Krishna’s concept of the Paramam Dhama (supreme abode) aligns with Buddha’s teaching — peace and liberation lie within, not in external pursuits."
8:22,"पुरुषः स परः पार्थ भक्त्या लभ्यस्त्वनन्यया ।
यस्यान्तःस्थानि भूतानि येन सर्वमिदं ततम् ॥८-२२॥","O Arjuna, that Supreme Divine Personality is attainable only through exclusive devotion. He is the all-pervading Being, within whom all living entities exist and by whom all this is pervaded.","Krishna reveals that the Supreme Divine (Parama Purusha) can only be attained through unwavering, exclusive devotion (Ananya Bhakti). This divine being exists in and through everything.",What you seek is seeking you.,Rumi,"Just as Krishna speaks of divine connection through devotion, Rumi’s words remind us that spiritual longing works both ways — the Divine seeks the devotee as much as the devotee seeks the Divine."
8:23,"यत्र काले त्वनावृत्तिमावृत्तिं चैव योगिनः ।
प्रयाता यान्ति तं कालं वक्ष्यामि भरतर्षभ ॥८-२३॥","O best of the Bharatas, I shall now explain the time at which yogis depart this world, never to return, and also the time at which they return.","Krishna introduces the concept of the timing of death — how spiritual seekers, depending on the time of departure, may either achieve liberation or return to the cycle of birth.","Timing is everything. If it’s meant to happen, it will, at the right time.",Anonymous,"Krishna’s emphasis on the timing of a yogi’s departure mirrors this quote — not just effort, but the right timing influences destiny."
8:24,"अग्निर्ज्योतिरहः शुक्लः षण्मासा उत्तरायणम् ।
तत्र प्रयाता गच्छन्ति ब्रह्म ब्रह्मविदो जनाः ॥८-२४॥","Those who depart during the time of fire, light, day, the bright fortnight, and the six months of the northern solstice (Uttarayana) attain the Supreme Brahman.","Krishna explains the path of light (Shukla Gati), symbolizing spiritual illumination. Departing souls during these auspicious times merge with the Supreme.",Light must come from inside. You cannot ask the darkness to leave; you must turn on the light.,Sogyal Rinpoche,"The journey through the path of light Krishna describes echoes Rinpoche’s insight — true illumination comes from within, leading to ultimate liberation."
8:25,"धूमो रात्रिस्तथा कृष्णः षण्मासा दक्षिणायनम् ।
तत्र चान्द्रमसं ज्योतिर्योगी प्राप्य निवर्तते ॥८-२५॥","But those who depart during the time of smoke, night, the dark fortnight, and the six months of the southern solstice (Dakshinayana) attain the lunar light and return again.",Krishna describes the path of darkness (Krishna Gati) — those who pass during inauspicious times reach temporary celestial realms but must return to the cycle of rebirth.,Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise.,Victor Hugo,Krishna’s teaching about cycles of light and dark parallels Hugo’s words — darkness (ignorance) is temporary; only spiritual wisdom (light) grants eternal liberation.
8:26,"शुक्लकृष्णे गती ह्येते जगतः शाश्वते मते ।
एकया यात्यनावृत्तिमन्ययावर्तते पुनः ॥८-२६॥","These two paths — the path of light (Shukla Gati) and the path of darkness (Krishna Gati) — are considered eternal. By one, a being attains liberation, and by the other, one returns to the cycle of rebirth.","Krishna describes the two eternal paths for the soul. The path of light leads to liberation, while the path of darkness binds one to the cycle of birth and death.",There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.,Edith Wharton,"Just as Krishna speaks of two spiritual paths, Edith Wharton’s quote reminds us that light (wisdom or spiritual progress) can be directly pursued or reflected through guidance — both ways matter in one's journey."
8:27,"नैते सृती पार्थ जानन्योगी मुह्यति कश्चन ।
तस्मात्सर्वेषु कालेषु योगयुक्तो भवार्जुन ॥८-२७॥","O Arjuna, knowing these two paths, no yogi is ever deluded. Therefore, at all times, be steadfast in yoga.","Krishna urges Arjuna to stay unwavering in his practice of yoga. Awareness of these spiritual paths empowers a yogi, keeping them from confusion.",Be steady and well-ordered in your life so that you can be fierce and original in your work.,Gustave Flaubert,"Like Krishna’s advice on steadiness in spiritual practice, Flaubert emphasizes balance and order as the foundation for deeper creativity and success — both in life and spirituality."
8:28,"वेदेषु यज्ञेषु तपःसु चैव
दानेषु यत्पुण्यफलं प्रदिष्टम् ।
अत्येति तत्सर्वमिदं विदित्वा

Such a yogi attains the supreme, eternal abode.","Krishna declares that a steadfast yogi surpasses all material rewards — from Vedic rituals, penances, and charity — attaining instead the highest spiritual goal: union with the Supreme.",Spirituality is not about getting what you want. It is about becoming who you truly are.,Eckhart Tolle,Krishna’s teaching that a yogi transcends material gains echoes Tolle’s idea — spiritual growth isn't about accumulation but about evolving into one's truest form.
9:1,"श्रीभगवानुवाच ।
इदं तु ते गुह्यतमं प्रवक्ष्याम्यनसूयवे ।
ज्ञानं विज्ञानसहितं यज्ज्ञात्वा मोक्ष्यसेऽशुभात् ॥९-१॥","The Blessed Lord said: I shall now reveal to you this most secret knowledge, combined with direct experience. Knowing this, you shall be freed from all misfortune.","Krishna introduces the ""royal knowledge"" — the supreme spiritual truth — promising that those who learn and experience it will transcend suffering and attain liberation. He highlights the blend of theoretical wisdom and direct spiritual experience.",Knowledge is of no value unless you put it into practice.,Anton Chekhov,Krishna's stress on wisdom paired with experience aligns with Chekhov's view — true understanding emerges only when knowledge is lived and practiced.
9:2,"राजविद्या राजगुह्यं पवित्रमिदमुत्तमम् ।
प्रत्यक्षावगमं धर्म्यं सुसुखं कर्तुमव्ययम् ॥९-२॥","This is the king of sciences and the most profound secret. It is supremely purifying, directly realizable, righteous, easy to practice, and imperishable.","Krishna declares this knowledge as the highest and most sacred, offering direct realization of divine truth. It’s a path that's pure, simple, and everlasting — transcending rituals to focus on inner transformation.",Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.,Leonardo da Vinci,"Just as Krishna describes this knowledge as simple yet profound, da Vinci's quote captures how true wisdom often lies in simplicity, not complexity."
9:3,"अश्रद्दधानाः पुरुषा धर्मस्यास्य परन्तप ।
अप्राप्य मां निवर्तन्ते मृत्युसंसारवर्त्मनि ॥९-३॥","People who lack faith in this dharma, O Arjuna, cannot attain Me. They repeatedly return to the cycle of birth and death.","Faith is crucial for spiritual growth. Krishna warns that without belief in the divine truth, people remain bound to the cycle of rebirth, unable to realize ultimate liberation.",Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase.,Martin Luther King Jr.,"Like Krishna’s emphasis on faith as the foundation for spiritual progress, MLK Jr.'s words highlight that believing without fully understanding is essential for taking the first steps toward growth."
9:4,"मया ततमिदं सर्वं जगदव्यक्तमूर्तिना ।
मत्स्थानि सर्वभूतानि न चाहं तेष्ववस्थितः ॥९-४॥","All beings abide in Me, but I am not confined to them. Though My unmanifest form pervades the universe, I remain beyond it.",Krishna reveals His omnipresence — He permeates all existence but is not limited by it. This paradox teaches that the divine is both immanent (within everything) and transcendent (beyond all forms).,God is a circle whose center is everywhere and circumference nowhere.,Empedocles,Empedocles' view mirrors Krishna’s description of divine omnipresence — present everywhere yet unrestricted by any boundary.
9:5,"न च मत्स्थानि भूतानि पश्य मे योगमैश्वरम् ।
भूतभृन्न च भूतस्थो ममात्मा भूतभावनः ॥९-५॥","And yet, the beings do not abide in Me — behold My divine mystery! Though I am the creator and sustainer of all beings, My true self remains detached.","Krishna presents a divine mystery: though He creates and supports all life, He remains untouched by it. This verse reflects the paradox of divine involvement without attachment — a core concept in spiritual philosophy.",Be in the world but not of the world.,Jesus Christ,Krishna's teaching echoes Jesus' wisdom — to engage with the world without being consumed by it — embodying spiritual detachment amidst worldly duties.
9:6,"यथाकाशस्थितो नित्यं वायुः सर्वत्रगो महान् ।
तथा सर्वाणि भूतानि मत्स्थानीत्युपधारय ॥९-६॥","Just as the great wind, moving everywhere, always remains in the sky, so do all beings rest in Me.","Krishna uses the analogy of wind in the sky to explain how all beings exist within Him, yet He remains unaffected. This highlights His omnipresence and detachment — He holds the universe together without being bound by it.","God is within everything, but not confined by anything.",Meister Eckhart,"Both Krishna and Eckhart describe divinity as all-pervading yet unbounded, reinforcing the concept of detached omnipresence."
9:7,"सर्वभूतानि कौन्तेय प्रकृतिं यान्ति मामिकाम् ।
कल्पक्षये पुनस्तानि कल्पादौ विसृजाम्यहम् ॥९-७॥","At the end of a cosmic cycle, all beings merge into My material nature, and at the beginning of the next, I create them again.","Krishna speaks of the cosmic rhythm — creation, dissolution, and recreation — governed by His will. It reflects the eternal cycle of existence, where all beings dissolve into Him and re-emerge at His command.",Every end is a new beginning.,Seneca,Krishna’s words about cosmic renewal echo Seneca's philosophy — endings are merely transitions to new beginnings — reinforcing the eternal cycle of life and rebirth.
9:8,"प्रकृतिं स्वामवष्टभ्य विसृजामि पुनः पुनः ।
भूतग्राममिमं कृत्स्नमवशं प्रकृतेर्वशात् ॥९-८॥","Controlling My material nature, I repeatedly create the multitude of beings, who are helplessly subject to its laws.","Krishna emphasizes that creation is an ongoing process, driven by His command, but the beings are bound by the laws of nature. Despite His control, the material world operates under a set divine order.",Nature is the art of God.,Dante Alighieri,"Krishna's control over nature mirrors Dante’s view — nature is a reflection of divine will, intricately designed yet governed by its own rules."
9:9,"न च मां तानि कर्माणि निबध्नन्ति धनञ्जय ।
उदासीनवदासीनमसक्तं तेषु कर्मसु ॥९-९॥","O Arjuna, these actions do not bind Me. I remain indifferent and unattached to all these works.","Krishna clarifies that, though He orchestrates creation and dissolution, He remains detached. His actions are not motivated by desire, emphasizing the principle of selfless action.","Do your work with all your heart, but never let it bind you.",Lao Tzu,Krishna's stance on detached action aligns with Lao Tzu’s philosophy — work wholeheartedly but without attachment — a core teaching of both spiritual traditions.
9:10,"मयाध्यक्षेण प्रकृतिः सूयते सचराचरम् ।
हेतुनानेन कौन्तेय जगद्विपरिवर्तते ॥९-१०॥","Under My supervision, material nature produces both the moving and the non-moving; thus, O Arjuna, the world revolves.","Krishna reveals that He governs the universe, overseeing the dynamic interaction of nature, yet remains above it. The world operates through divine orchestration.","The universe is not outside of you. Look inside yourself; everything that you want, you already are.",Rumi,"Krishna's role as the overseer of creation resonates with Rumi’s idea — divinity shapes the outer world, yet its essence resides within each being."
9:11,"अवजानन्ति मां मूढा मानुषीं तनुमाश्रितम् ।
परं भावमजानन्तो मम भूतमहेश्वरम् ॥९-११॥",Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature as the Supreme Lord of all beings.,"Krishna addresses how ignorant beings fail to recognize His divinity when He takes a human form. His true essence goes beyond physicality — He remains the Lord of all creation despite appearing in a relatable, mortal guise.",Do not judge by appearances; a rich heart may be under a poor coat.,Scottish Proverb,"This aligns with Krishna's message — outward appearances can deceive. His divine form is hidden, just as wisdom or greatness often lies beneath humble exteriors."
9:12,"मोघाशा मोघकर्माणो मोघज्ञाना विचेतसः ।
राक्षसीमासुरीं चैव प्रकृतिं मोहिनीं श्रिताः ॥९-१२॥","Those who are bewildered are attracted by demonic and atheistic views. Their hopes, actions, and knowledge are all in vain.","Krishna warns that those led by ignorance and selfish desires fall into demonic tendencies. Their aspirations and actions, lacking a higher purpose, yield no true fulfillment.","Without knowledge, action is useless, and knowledge without action is futile.",Abu Bakr,"Just as Abu Bakr highlights the futility of misguided actions, Krishna emphasizes that without spiritual wisdom, even the most ambitious efforts are fruitless."
9:13,"महात्मानस्तु मां पार्थ दैवीं प्रकृतिमाश्रिताः ।
भजन्त्यनन्यमनसो ज्ञात्वा भूतादिमव्ययम् ॥९-१३॥","But the great souls, O Arjuna, who take shelter in the divine nature, know Me as the imperishable source of all beings and worship Me with undivided minds.","Krishna contrasts the enlightened souls with the ignorant ones. Great souls, rooted in divine consciousness, recognize His eternal nature and worship Him with unwavering devotion.",The soul that sees beauty may sometimes walk alone.,Goethe,"Krishna's ""great souls"" reflect Goethe's idea — those who perceive divine truth may walk a path of solitude and inner devotion, undistracted by worldly illusions."
9:14,"सततं कीर्तयन्तो मां यतन्तश्च दृढव्रताः ।
नमस्यन्तश्च मां भक्त्या नित्ययुक्ता उपासते ॥९-१४॥","Always chanting My glories, striving with determination, bowing before Me in devotion — these souls worship Me constantly with steadfast resolve.","Krishna describes the devotion of true seekers — they continuously glorify Him, driven by unwavering dedication. Their focus is constant, reflecting their spiritual commitment.","Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.",Winston Churchill,"Just as Krishna praises determined seekers, Churchill's quote reflects the same resilience — devotion requires relentless dedication, despite life’s ups and downs."
9:15,"ज्ञानयज्ञेन चाप्यन्ये यजन्तो मामुपासते ।
एकत्वेन पृथक्त्वेन बहुधा विश्वतोमुखम् ॥९-१५॥","Others, engaging in the yajña of knowledge, worship Me in various ways — seeing Me as one with everything, as separate, or in multiple forms.","Krishna acknowledges diverse spiritual paths. Some view Him as the all-encompassing One, others as a distinct divine being, while some worship His many forms. All approaches ultimately lead to Him.","There are many paths to the top of the mountain, but the view is always the same.",Chinese Proverb,"Krishna’s inclusivity of multiple spiritual views mirrors this proverb — the paths may differ, but the destination (divine realization) remains the same."
9:16,"अहं क्रतुरहं यज्ञः स्वधाहमहमौषधम् ।
मन्त्रोऽहमहमेवाज्यमहमग्निरहं हुतम् ॥९-१६॥","I am the ritual, I am the sacrifice, I am the offering to the ancestors, I am the healing herb, I am the sacred chant, I am the clarified butter, I am the fire, and I am the act of offering.","Krishna declares that He is the essence of all spiritual practices — the rituals, sacrifices, and offerings. Everything in a spiritual act stems from Him, reinforcing His omnipresence.","God is not in the sky or far away. He is within you, in your heart.",Mahatma Gandhi,"Just as Krishna identifies Himself as the core of all practices, Gandhi reminds us that the divine is not distant but an inseparable part of our being."

वेद्यं पवित्रमोंकार ऋक्साम यजुरेव च ॥९-१७॥","I am the father of this universe, the mother, the support, and the grandsire. I am the object of knowledge, the purifier, and the syllable Om.

His essence pervades all spiritual knowledge, as symbolized by the sacred Vedas and Om.",All that we are is the result of what we have thought.,Buddha,"Just as Krishna embodies all cosmic elements, Buddha emphasizes that our thoughts shape our reality — both concepts highlight the interconnectedness of all things."
9:18,"गतिर्भर्ता प्रभुः साक्षी निवासः शरणं सुहृत् ।
प्रभवः प्रलयः स्थानं निधानं बीजमव्ययम् ॥९-१८॥","I am the goal, the sustainer, the master, the witness, the abode, the refuge, and the most dear friend.

ते पुण्यमासाद्य सुरेन्द्रलोकमश्नन्ति दिव्यान्दिवि देवभोगान् ॥९-२०॥","Those who follow the Vedas, drinking the soma juice and seeking the heavenly realms, worship Me indirectly through sacrifices. They reach the heavens, enjoy divine pleasures, and then return to the mortal world.","Krishna acknowledges those performing rituals for heavenly rewards. However, He hints at the temporary nature of such pleasures, subtly emphasizing that true liberation lies beyond transient joys.",The foolish man seeks happiness in the distance; the wise grows it under his feet.,James Oppenheim,Krishna’s message aligns with Oppenheim’s wisdom — seeking external rewards (heavenly or worldly) is fleeting.

Thus, those who follow the Vedic rites, seeking desires, repeatedly come and go between the realms of pleasure and suffering.",Krishna points out the impermanence of heavenly rewards. Even those who achieve celestial joys must return to the cycle of birth and death once their merits are depleted — emphasizing the futility of desire-driven rituals.,What goes up must come down.,Isaac Newton,"Just as Newton’s law speaks of gravity, Krishna highlights a spiritual version of this truth — temporary joys inevitably fade, pulling one back into the cycle of rebirth."

यजन्ते श्रद्धयान्विताः।
तेऽपि मामेव कौन्तेय
यजन्त्यविधिपूर्वकम् ॥९-२३॥","Even those who worship other deities with faith actually worship Me, O Arjuna, though in an improper way.","Krishna clarifies that all forms of worship ultimately reach Him, even if the devotee doesn’t realize it. However, worship that lacks proper understanding remains incomplete.","Paths are many, but the truth is one.",Swami Vivekananda,"Just as Swami Vivekananda taught that all spiritual paths lead to the same truth, Krishna acknowledges that even indirect devotion is still devotion to Him."

Thus liberated, you will attain Me.","Krishna explains that surrendering all actions to Him neutralizes karma’s binding effects, liberating the soul from the cycle of birth and death.",Freedom comes when you learn to let go.,Buddha,Krishna's words align with Buddha’s philosophy — liberation arises from detachment and selfless devotion.
